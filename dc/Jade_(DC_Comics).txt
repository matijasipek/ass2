Jade learned of her twin brother Todd when she was in her late teens. Shortly after she met Todd, the two siblings tried to join the Justice Society. They were rejected but joined with other children and protégés of JSA members to form Infinity Inc.\n\nDue to their father\'s exposure to magical energies, Jade and her brother were born with [[metahuman]] powers. Jade\'s powers first manifested when she was a child when she defended herself against sexual harassment. Jade\'s powers resembled her father\'s in that she was able to generate green energy and shape it into constructs. Jade also inherited her mother\'s power of plant manipulation.\n\nJade made a career in modeling in California then left to pursue photography in New York City. There, her roommate was [[Kyle Rayner]]. Jade and Kyle became romantically involved. When Jade lost her powers in a battle with Starheart, Kyle gave her a spare power ring and battery, thus making her a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. Kyle later restored her powers during his first, short tenure as the god-like [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]].<ref>\'\'[[Green Lantern]]\'\' (vol. 3) #148 (May 2002). DC Comics.</ref> Jade\'s power ring eventually passed to [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]].\n\nAfter Kyle\'s friend [[Terry Berg]] was attacked, Jade and Kyle left Earth. After completing a number of missions, Jade returned to Earth. She ended her relationship with Kyle after falling in love with another man. Jade then served as a member and leader of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. Around this time, Jade assisted [[Donna Troy]] and some of the alumni of the [[Teen Titans]] in their battle against the [[Titans of Myth (comics)|Titans of Myth]]. Jade also assisted the Green Lantern Corps in \'\'[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]\'\' to defeat and imprison the parasitic fear entity, [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]].\n\nIn the \'\'[[Rann-Thanagar War|Rann-Thanagar War Infinite Crisis Special]]\'\', Jade died while trying to prevent [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] from tearing the universe into a multiverse. Her consciousness and powers lingered until her Starheart powers merged with Kyle, awakening the Ion entity sleeping within him.\n\nIn the story arc "[[One Year Later]]", Alan Scott lay in a coma after an attack by the [[Gentleman Ghost]]. The original Jade appeared to him to say goodbye, granting him another portion of her green energy which replaced his eye that he had lost during the 2005–2006 \'\'[[Infinite Crisis]]\'\' storyline.<ref>\'\'JSA\'\' #83-85 (May – July 2006).

However, Kyle recognized her lies after witnessing the attack of the Black Lantern Corps on the planet [[Oa]]. Kyle became enraged and tried to destroy the Black Lantern Corps. Jade captured Kyle and tormented him with black energy constructs of [[Alexandra DeWitt]], Donna Troy, his mother (Moira Rayner), and herself. This was to remind Kyle of his failures to save the women who were important to him.<ref name="glc40">\'\'Green Lantern Corps\'\' (vol. 2) #40 (September 2009).

[[Mogo]] caused all of the Black Lanterns, including Jade, to be pulled down to the planet Oa and absorbed into its core. There, super-hot magma continually burned up the Black Lanterns, preventing them from regenerating their forms.\n\n===Return===\nDuring the finale of \'\'Blackest Night\'\', Jade and a few of the Black Lanterns are resurrected in their true forms.

DC Comics.</ref> The green crystal meteor was the \'\'Starheart\'\', the legendary crystal that gave Alan Scott his powers and therefore, Jade, her powers. After waking, Jade revealed that while on Oa, the Starheart had kidnapped her and brought her to Earth in order to locate her father. However, on learning that the Starheart had taken control of her father\'s body, she opted to help the Justice League to stop him.<ref>\'\'Justice League of America\'\' (vol. 2) #45 (May 2010). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nJade joined with the JLA and JSA in order to stop metahumans who were under the control of the Starheart. At the same time, [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mr. Terrific]] searched for a way to weaken the Starheart\'s power. Jade used her father\'s old lantern to make a brief connection with her father. The insignia of the Black Lantern Corps was briefly shown, floating behind her.<ref>\'\'Justice League of America\'\' (vol. 2) #46 (June 2010).

DC Comics.</ref> The White Light Entity separated Jade and Obsidian. Obsidian tried to make the fusion occur again, but Kyle restrained and removed him.

As a result of her fusion with Obsidian, Jade was no longer able to be in close proximity to her brother without risking further threat from the Starheart.<ref>\'\'Justice League of America\'\' (vol. 2) #48 (August 2010).

After taking over Jade, Eclipso has the power of the Starheart and defeats and possesses the Justice League\'s reserve roster and then badly injures the angel Zauriel. With the Justice League outnumbered, Eclipso then reveals his ultimate goal is to somehow kill God. Eclipso then tortures Zauriel, causing his screams to attract the attention of the new Spectre, Crispus Allen, whom he kills, absorbing the Spectre\'s powers upon his demise. With his newfound abilities, Eclipso reveals that God relies on the collective love of humanity in order to stay alive and that by destroying Earth, Eclipso will ultimately kill God once and for all. Just as the members of the JLA prepare to wage a counterattack, Eclipso destroys the Moon, apparently dooming all life on Earth. With the Moon destroyed, Eclipso then seemingly kills Donna Troy, the physically strongest remaining member of the Justice League. It is ultimately revealed that Donna\'s death was an illusion conjured by Saint Walker, who used his blue power ring to temporarily trap Eclipso in a state of euphoria. After the Atom and Starman break Eclipso\'s link to his brainwashed slaves, the combined heroes attack Eclipso together, defeating him. In the aftermath, it is discovered that Jade and Obsidian can now be within proximity of each other again and their father has control of the Starheart.\n\nAfter a battle with the villain D\'arken and releasing the Starheart energies, Jade\'s father Alan Scott\'s body is incinerated. Afterward, there is a funeral for Alan, whom the JSA and Jade believe to be dead.<ref>\'\'Justice Society of America\'\' (vol. 3) #54 (August 2011). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nAs part of the JLA, Jade played a major role in ending the Saturn-Thanagar War by channeling the Starheart\'s power to magnify the telepathic abilities of the new colonists of Titan to compel the Thanagaran fleet to leave.\n\nJade was removed from continuity with "[[The New 52]]" and "[[DC Rebirth]]". It was revealed later that this was because of [[Doctor Manhattan]] altering the timeline that prevented her father from becoming Green Lantern.{{efn|As revealed in \'\'[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]\'\' #7. DC Comics.}}\n\nIn the "[[Watchmen]]" sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]", Jade is among the Justice Society of America members that returns after Doctor Manhattan undoes the experiment that erased the Justice Society of America and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]].<ref>\'\'Doomsday Clock\'\' #12.

DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nJade has Starheart energy manipulation powers similar to those of her father. However, unlike her father, her powers do not come from a ring or a lantern but are channeled through the star-shaped birthmark on her palm. As it is with all Green Lanterns, Jade can bring unlimited green energy constructs to life. She can use the constructs in any way, limited only by her will, imagination, and endurance. She uses the constructs most often to create shields, to fly, to travel through outer space and to run very quickly. Jade\'s power often manifests as green fire. Jade is unable to affect any object made of wood.\n\nJade inherited from her mother the ability to affect plants. Jade can cause accelerated growth of plants and manipulate the movement of most plant life. This ability manifests later in her life and thus she is less familiar with it.\n\nTechnically speaking, Jade is a meta-human. She was born with green-hued skin, dark green hair, green eyes and a star-shaped birthmark on her palm. Her skin contains chlorophyll (the source of its green hue), and she can photosynthesize sunlight as a plant does. Due to their shared mystical connection with the Starheart, Jade can sense where her twin brother and her father are. She once shared a telepathic connection with her brother.\n\nAs a member of the Green Lantern Corps, Jade wielded a power ring. Its power is not from the Starheart but from an aspect of the Emotional Spectrum. The power ring gave Jade abilities which were similar to her natural powers. It required recharging every 24 hours by her power battery. Jade\'s ring has a [[Parallax (comics)|yellow impurity]] which required her to face her fears and overcome them with green willpower in order to master it. As a Black Lantern, Jade wielded a black power ring, but as a reanimated corpse she is not in control of her body or powers.\n\n==Other characters named Jade==\n===Nicki Jones===\n[[Image:Newjade.PNG|thumb|right|150px|The new Jade, Nicki Jones, is introduced, art by [[Chris Batista]].]]\nIn \'\'52\'\' Week 29, a young woman named \'\'\'Nicki Jones\'\'\' was introduced as a member of the new [[Lex Luthor]]-owned [[Infinity, Inc.]] under the superhero name \'\'Jade\'\'.

During an attack upon her family, she is chosen by a [[Green Lantern]] power ring, which greatly enhances her hearing. This allows her to "see" via a set of special headphones, as well as granting her the ability to create energy constructs and changing her skin color to green. Though she possesses the green skin of her original counterpart, the Ame-Comi version of Jade uses a power ring rather than an internal source of energy.<ref>\'\'[[Ame-Comi Girls]]\'\' #7.

As [[Pat Dugan]] trains Jennie to control her powers, which initially appear to be connected to Scott\'s lantern, Courtney eventually apologizes. After feeling isolated and emotional over her missing brother [[Obsidian (comics)|Todd Rice]], Jennie breaks the lantern and strengthens her powers, after which Dugan theorizes Jennie herself is the source.
