The character was later played by [[Robert Knepper]], appearing in episodes from the [[Arrow (season 2)|\'\'Arrow\'\'\'s second season]] and \'\'[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]\'\' set in the [[Arrowverse]]. The character, named \'\'\'Temple Fugate\'\'\', appeared in shows set in the [[DC Animated Universe]] voiced by [[Alan Rachins]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\nThe first Clock King was originally an enemy of [[Green Arrow]]. He has no superpowers or abilities. He wears a clock mask, a cape, and a blue suit with clock drawings on it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |page=92}}</ref>\n\nClock King is a master planner and sometimes uses [[clock]]-themed gadgetry. The Clock King became better known more recently by his appearances in \'\'[[Justice League International]]\'\' and \'\'[[Suicide Squad]]\'\'.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===William Tockman===\nBorn \'\'\'William Tockman\'\'\', the Clock King spends his early years taking care of his invalid sister. During one day, he finds out from a doctor\'s visit that he himself only has six months to live. Despairing for his sister\'s future, he watches the timing of a local bank\'s vault in order to rob it, hoping the money would provide for his sister after he was gone. His caper would have gone successfully, had he not tripped a silent alarm and been caught by Green Arrow.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Cite book | last = Wallace | first = Dan | contribution = Clock King | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | page = 84 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1 | oclc = 213309017}}</ref>\n\nWhile he is incarcerated, his sister dies alone. In further and hideous irony, Tockman discovers that he really is not terminally ill; his doctor had accidentally switched his papers with those of another patient. Infuriated, he escapes, later futilely attempting revenge on both Green Arrow and the incompetent doctor.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=60}}</ref>\n\nWith several other villains, the Clock King becomes a member of the Injustice League, a team of out-of-luck supervillains who, when banding together, become even less successful than they have been in their individual careers.<ref>\'\'Justice League International\'\' #23 (January 1989)</ref> The Injustice League is defeated time and again by the [[Justice League International]], at least when they are not making laughingstocks of themselves. Trying to reform, the members later become the core of the equally laughable hero team Justice League Antarctica. This JLA includes G\'Nort, who ends up saving the lives of the entire team.<ref>\'\'Justice League America\'\' Annual #4 (October 1990)</ref> Like his compatriots, Clock King becomes an ardent supporter of [[Maxwell Lord]], partly due to the fact he is the only one willing to hire them. His group even guards Lord when he is incapacitated by a bullet wound.<ref>\'\'Justice League America\'\' #53 (August 1991)</ref> The villains again later reunite as the Injustice League as henchmen of [[Sonar (comics)|Sonar]].<ref>\'\'Justice League Europe\'\' #49&ndash;50 (April&ndash;May 1993)</ref>\n\nLater, the Clock King leads his own separate team of villains in a mission. They consist of Radiant, Sharpe, Acidia, and Crackle. They are not as well-organized as even the Injustice League. For example, Crackle still lives with his mother and they have to take the bus to their fight. It takes place at a [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] toy store. They end up fighting one of the many incarnations of the [[Teen Titans]], the heroes [[Booster Gold]] and [[Firehawk (comics)|Firehawk]] and DEO agent [[Cameron Chase]]. An unclear super-effect from Chase ultimately neutralizes Clock King\'s team and they are all imprisoned. Clock King himself escapes on another bus.<ref>\'\'Chase\'\' #4 (May 1998)</ref>\n\nStill later, Clock King and his Injustice League friends are transformed into the new [[Suicide Squad]]. They are sent to a remote research facility where a [[gene]]tic monstrosity is holding its creator hostage. Its main defenses are spawned "children" that could explode. During the mission, most of the team are seemingly killed, including Clock King, who is shot repeatedly in a retreat attempt. He is seen still alive after his brutal wounds but, in the end, [[Major Disaster]] believes he is the only one who survives. It turns out [[Cluemaster]], shot in a similar manner as Clock King, survives, albeit with drastic scarring.<ref>\'\'Suicide Squad\'\' (vol. 2) #1</ref><ref name="dc-ency"/> [[Multi-Man]] also survives due to his ability to be reborn with new powers after dying.\n\nClock King is not seen for a period of time after \'\'[[Infinite Crisis]]\'\'. In an issue of \'\'[[52 (comics)|52]]\'\', one character decides to kill all the time-travelers, and mentions someone "ending up like [[Time Commander (comics)|Time Commander]] and Clock Queen".\n\n===Tem===\nA new Clock King appears in \'\'[[Teen Titans]]\'\' #56 as the head of a team of villains named the [[Terror Titans]]. In an interview with \'\'Teen Titans\'\' writer Sean McKeever, he described this Clock King as "... Very smart.

He sends the Militia to attack [[Los Angeles]], for no reason other than to amuse him.<ref>\'\'Terror Titans\'\' #5 (April 2009)</ref> Clock King\'s plans are eventually undone by [[Miss Martian]], who was posing as one of the captured Metahumans, and Ravager, who attacks and defeats him, forcing him to flee his base of operations.<ref>\'\'Terror Titans\'\' #6 (May 2009)</ref>\n\n===\'\'The New 52\'\'===\nIn \'\'[[The New 52]]\'\', three iterations of the Clock King appeared:\n* \'\'\'Billy Tockman\'\'\' is an African-American crime boss based in Seattle.

When Green Arrow returns and faces Dragon, he holds Naomi and Fyff at gunpoint on Dragon\'s orders and ends up shooting Fyff, then promptly getting beat up and knocked out by [[Emiko Queen]].\n* Another Clock King, wearing the original Clock King costume, battles the newest incarnation of the [[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]] amped up on Venom.<ref>\'\'Batman: The Dark Knight\'\' (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011)</ref> \n* Another, bearing an appearance similar to his Animated Series look (but with a black and blue suit and black and yellow glasses), tries to rob a store alongside his roommate [[Sportsmaster]], who calls him \'\'\'Bill\'\'\'.

He is sheltered within the African nation of Buredunia under dictator Matthew Bland. His actions drew the attention of [[Deathstroke the Terminator]], who was assigned by Bland to kill Clock King as revenge for his murders. However, Clock King managed to save his life by revealing that the warlord would kill Deathstroke after he had finished the job. He later kidnaps Bland. During the fight, Slade shoots him, revealing his powers to be special effects. Furthermore, Clock King revealed that as a time anomaly, he saw that as a result of [[Doctor Manhattan]]\'s [[Doomsday Clock (comics)|manipulation of the timestream]] led to the rebirth of Deathstroke\'s ally [[Wintergreen (comics)|Wintergreen]]. With that information, Deathstroke spared Clock King\'s life.<ref>\'\'Deathstroke: Rebirth\'\' #1 and \'\'Deathstroke\'\' (vol. 4) #1</ref>\n* A former engineer and drug dealer in a suit, sporting glasses inherited from his grandfather<ref>\'\'Nightwing\'\' (vol. 3) #24-25</ref> and having a tattoo of a clock and arrow on the side of his head, he wired targets to clocks that can kill the wearer.<ref>\'\'Green Arrow\'\' (vol. 7)</ref> This version would later face Batman.

He extensively uses clock and time -related gimmicks to devastating effect.\n* The second Clock King has the always-active ability to see what is about to happen four seconds or so into the future, allowing him to anticipate an opponent\'s every move.<ref name=tt59 /> He is also a technological genius, creating devices such as teleporters, communications jamming equipment, and even an anti-gravity platform, all of them modelled after timepieces.\n\n==Other versions==\n===\'\'Flashpoint\'\'===\nIn the alternate timeline of the \'\'[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\'\' event, Clock King is imprisoned in [[Legion of Doom (Super Friends)|military Doom prison]].

At the end, it is revealed that he is Jervis Tetch\'s brother, \'\'\'Morris Tetch\'\'\', who made much of the Mad Hatter\'s more advanced weapons and described himself and his brother as both "meticulous obsessives", Jervis loving hats and Morris clocks.<ref>\'\'Batman \'66\'\' #4</ref>\n\n===\'\'The Batman Adventures\'\'===\nThe Clock King also makes an appearance in a 2004 \'\'[[The Batman Adventures]]\'\' comic.

In the consecutive episodes, "The Clock King\'s Crazy Crimes" and "The Clock King Gets Crowned", he disguises himself as a pop artist and tries to rob a time-related [[surrealism|surrealist]] painting. [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] intervene, but are captured and stuffed into the bottom of an oversized hourglass, stripped of their utility belts, and left to be drowned in sand as the Clock King plots to filch Bruce Wayne\'s collection of antique pocket watches, only for the Dynamic Duo to escape the trap.

However, due to a string of bad luck, Fugate shows up late for his court appointment, loses his appeal, and goes bankrupt as a result. He later learns that Hill\'s firm represented the plaintiff for the case and swears revenge on Hill for making him late. Seven years later, Fugate becomes the Clock King and dedicates his life to destroying Hill. After publicly shaming him, Fugate has a confrontation with Batman and falls to his apparent death, only to return in the episode "Time Out of Joint", continuing to seek revenge against Hill by utilizing a stolen device that allows him to manipulate time and incorporating it into a bomb.
