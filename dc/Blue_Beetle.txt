The most recent of the companies to own rights to Blue Beetle is [[DC Comics]], which bought the rights to the character in 1983, using the name for three distinct characters over the years.\n\nThe original Blue Beetle was created by [[Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski]] and [[Fox Comics]] and later owned by [[Charlton Comics]]. The first Beetle was \'\'\'[[Dan Garret]]\'\'\' (later spelled Dan Garrett), who initially gained superpowers from a special vitamin, which was later changed to gaining powers from a "sacred scarab". The original Blue Beetle was featured in not only his own comic but also a weekly [[Golden Age of Radio|radio serial]].\n\nThe second Blue Beetle, created by Charlton and later taken over by [[DC Comics]], was the successor to Dan Garrett known as \'\'\'[[Ted Kord]]\'\'\'. Kord "jumped" to the DC Comics universe during the \'\'[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\'\' alongside a number of other Charlton Comics characters. The second Blue Beetle later starred in his own 24-issue comic. Kord never had any super powers but used science to create various devices to help him fight crime. He became a member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] and was later killed during the prelude to DC Comics\' \'\'[[Infinite Crisis]]\'\' cross over.\n\nThe third Blue Beetle, created by DC Comics, is \'\'\'[[Jaime Reyes]]\'\'\', a teenager who discovers that the original Blue Beetle scarab morphs into a battle suit allowing him to fight crime and travel in space. Over the years, Reyes became a member of the [[Teen Titans]] and starred in two Blue Beetle comic series. In DC Comics\' 2011 "New 52" reboot, Jaime Reyes was the primary Blue Beetle character, only occasionally referring to past versions. With the subsequent continuity revision "DC Rebirth", the previous versions were restored.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{See also|Blue Beetle (comic book)}}\nThe original Blue Beetle, [[Dan Garret]], [[First appearance|first appeared]] in [[Fox Comics]]\' \'\'[[Mystery Men Comics]]\'\' #1 (cover-dated August 1939), with art by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski (as [[Charles Nicholas#Charles Wojtkoski|Charles Nicholas]]), though the [[Grand Comics Database]] tentatively credits [[Will Eisner]] as the scripter.<ref>Wojtkoski\'s family has supplied the online comics encyclopedia "The Lambiek Comiclopedia" with documentation to support the overall Wojtkoski credit. Another artist, [[Charles Nicholas#Chuck Cuidera|Charles Nicholas Cuidera]], also drew Blue YEEtle stories later, and has claimed to have been the creator, but comics historians credit Wojtkoski.\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/490/#11|title=\'\'Mystery Men Comics\'\' #1|access-date=June 22, 2007|author=Mougin, Lou|work=[[Grand Comics Database]]}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/n/nicholas_charles2.htm|title=Charles Nicholas|access-date=September 17, 2010|work=The Lambiek Comiclopedia}}</ref> A rookie [[police officer]], he wore a special bulletproof costume and took "Vitamin 2X" which endowed him with super-energy, and he was assisted by a neighborhood pharmacist in his fight against crime. Blue Beetle starred in a comic book series, [[comic strip]] and [[radio]] serial, but like most [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes, he fell into obscurity in the 1950s. The comic book series saw a number of anomalies in publication: 19 issues, #12 through #30, were published through [[Holyoke Publishing]]; no issue #43 was published; publication frequency varied throughout the run; and there were gaps where issues were not published, with large ones occurring in early 1947 and between mid-1948 and early 1950.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Fox Comics went out of business and sold the printing plates to some stories featuring the Blue Beetle to [[Charlton Comics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/foxfeatr.htm|title=Fox Feature Syndicate|publisher=[[Don Markstein\'s Toonopedia]]|access-date=September 13, 2010|archive-date=2012-04-15|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66vzd3Z5l?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/foxfeatr.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The first \'\'Blue Beetle\'\' series to be published by Charlton Comics took over numbering from the horror anthology series \'\'The Thing!\'\', beginning with issue #18 (cover dated February 1955).

The first issue (cover dated June 1964) was a new origin story that depicted Dan Garrett coming into possession of a mystical Egyptian [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] that granted him superpowers and beginning his career as the Blue Beetle. After five issues were published, the next issue was numbered as #50 (cover dated July 1965), taking over numbering from the anthology comic \'\'Unusual Tales\'\'. The series ended with issue #54 (cover dated February-March 1966), its numbering taken over afterwards by the anthology comic \'\'Ghostly Tales\'\'. Issues #1-5 and #50-53 were written by [[Joe Gill]] and issue #54 by [[Roy Thomas]]; art for all ten issues was by [[Bill Fraccio]] and [[Tony Tallarico]].\n\nLater in 1966, Blue Beetle was reinvented again in a set of backup stories published in \'\'[[Captain Atom]]\'\' #83 (cover-dated November 1966) through #86, plotted and drawn by [[Steve Ditko]]:<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]]|cowriters=[[Gary Friedrich]]|artist=Ditko, Steve|title=[[Captain Atom]]|issue=#83|date=November 1966|publisher=[[Charlton Comics]]}}</ref> they introduced [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Ted Kord]], a student of Dan Garrett\'s, who took on the role of Blue Beetle following Garrett\'s apparent death.

It revealed that the original 1940s Dan was reincarnated as the Silver Age version (minus his memories of his earlier existence) by some unspecified "gods", presumably the ones responsible for his mystic scarab. The gods subsequently resurrected Dan again and sent him off to save Ted Kord\'s life (leaving him a note saying simply, "Try not to get killed this time").

Before dying, he had used the scarab in an attempt to contact [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]], but was forced to leave it with the wizard [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] in the Rock of Eternity when the wizard sent him back to [[Earth]].<ref>\'\'[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]\'\' one-shot (May 2005)</ref>\n\nSome time later, [[Booster Gold]], along with Jaime, Dan, and the [[Black Beetle (DC Comics)|Black Beetle]] in the guise of a Blue Beetle from the future, travels back in time to rescue Kord moments before his death.<ref name="BGv2i6"/>\n\n===Jaime Reyes===\n{{Main|Jaime Reyes}}\n\'\'\'Jaime Reyes\'\'\' is a teenager who lives in [[El Paso, Texas]], with his father, mother, and little sister; his father owns a garage and his mother is a nurse. Jaime has offered to help his father out at the garage, but his father has turned him down. He feels Jaime should enjoy his childhood for as long as he can, and should attempt to further his education.

His large and loving family is a major source of strength and guidance for Jaime. [[Peacemaker (comics)|Christopher Smith aka the Peacemaker]] also became a mentor for the young Blue Beetle.\n\nJaime co-starred along with the rest of the former Justice League International in \'\'[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]\'\'.\n\nFollowing DC\'s "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline \'\'Blue Beetle\'\' was one of 52 monthly titles launched in September 2011, again starring Jaime Reyes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2011/06/09/blue-beetle-1/|title=BLUE BEETLE #1|work=DC Comics|date=9 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2011/08/17/who%25e2%2580%2599s-who-at-dc-comics-the-new-52-tony-bedard|author=David Hyde|title=Who\'s Who at DC Comics-The New 52: Tony Bedard|date=August 17, 2011|access-date=June 6, 2017}}</ref> The series was cancelled after 17 issues in January 2013.\n\n==The Scarab – Khaji Da==\nThe Blue Beetle scarab, previously shown as an artifact of magic, is later [[retcon]]ned as a tool of war of the [[Reach (comics)|Reach]], an ancient race of cosmic marauders. After being defeated by the [[Guardians of the Universe]] thousands of years ago and forced into a truce, the Reach poses as benevolent aliens lending their advanced technology to budding civilizations. The scarab is a gift for that world\'s champion, giving him amazing powers and the knowledge of the Reach to protect their peers. Secretly, the scarab is part of an advanced hive mind, with its own artificial intelligence covertly supplanting the wearer\'s own. The wearer is turned into the "ultimate infiltrator", a covert agent intended to take over its own world.<ref name="BBv6i18"/> However, the Blue Beetle Scarab is damaged and so instead of it controlling the host, it forms a symbiotic relationship with them.\n\nThe Blue Beetle scarab uses its serial number, Khaji Da, as its name.<ref>\'\'Blue Beetle\'\' (vol. 7) #25</ref>\n\nIn the New 52, the Reach forgoes the secrecy, and each wearer immediately becomes possessed by the scarab. It then uses its host\'s knowledge to decimate the world and prepare it for a full invasion by Reach forces.<ref>\'\'Blue Beetle\'\' (vol. 8) #0 (September 2012)</ref>\n\nIn \'\'DC Universe: Rebirth\'\', Ted Kord and Jaime Reyes believe the scarab is an alien device that bonded to Jaime\'s spine. Kord is fascinated by this scarab and wants to investigate the potential of it while Jaime fears it. When Jaime leaves Kord\'s lab to get to school, Dr. Fate appears in the lab to warn Kord that the scarab is not an alien device, but it is instead magic. This further sparks Kord\'s interest in the potential of the scarab.\n\n==Enemies==\n{{Main|List of Blue Beetle enemies}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===Kingdom Come===\nBlue Beetle (Ted Kord) was seen in [[Alex Ross]] and [[Mark Waid]]\'s limited series \'\'[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]\'\'. He is shown with the rest of the Charlton "Action Heroes" not as a member of [[Magog (comics)|Magog]]\'s [[Justice Battalion]], but as part of [[Batman]]\'s group and later of the MLF (Mankind Liberation Front). He would be shown later in the title in a suit of armor powered by the then-mystic scarab, working with Batman\'s team. In the novelization of the series, Batman thinks of Blue Beetle, along with [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]], as his closest (at the time) friends. Blue Beetle is killed with most of the other heroes by a nuclear explosion.\n\n===52 Multiverse===\n[[Image:Blue Beetle Elseworld.jpg|thumb|The [[Gotham by Gaslight#Countdown|Earth-19]] Blue Beetle.]]\n\nThe final issue, #52, of DC Comics\' 2006/2007 year-long weekly series \'\'[[52 (comics)|52]]\'\' revealed that a "[[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]]" system of [[Worlds of the 52 multiverse|52 parallel universes]], with each Earth being a different take on established DC Comics characters as featured in the mainstream continuity (designated as "New Earth") had come into existence. The Multiverse acts as a storytelling device that allows writers to introduce alternate versions of fictional characters, hypothesize "What if?" scenarios, revisit popular Elseworlds stories and allow these characters to interact with the mainstream continuity. For example, the Ted Kord of the \'\'Kingdom Come\'\' limited series is said to reside on Earth-22.\n\nSpin-offs from the series \'\'[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]\'\' would introduce more alternate Blue Beetles in 2007. Earth-19 (the \'\'[[Gotham by Gaslight]]\'\' universe), set in a Victorian-like era, has its own version of Dan Garrett who in his secret identity is the leading Egyptologist at the Gotham Museum of Natural History and wears a monocle, appearing in \'\'The Search for Ray Palmer: Gotham by Gaslight\'\'. The limited series \'\'[[Countdown: Arena]]\'\' depicted three more: Earth-26 Blue Beetle, a swarm of sentient insects that form a man-shaped body (calling themselves "The Scarab"), Ted of Earth-33, an anthropomorphic beetle, the pet of Mr. and Mrs. Kord, and Earth-39 Blue Beetle, a younger version of Dan Garrett, who has bonded with his scarab in the same way as Jaime Reyes.<ref>\'\'Countdown: Arena\'\' #1–4 (December 2007)</ref>\n\nA new version of the Blue Beetle known as "Blue Scarab" was shown as a member of the Justice League in the apocalyptic future depicted in \'\'Justice League: Generation Lost\'\'. He is stated as being the "descendant of the Blue Beetle", and has a very alien-looking appearance.<ref>\'\'Justice League: Generation Lost\'\' #14 (Late January 2011)</ref>\n\nAn evil version has appeared in the [[antimatter universe of Qward]], the [[universe]] of the [[Crime Syndicate of America]], known as the Scarab.\n\n===DC Animated Universe comics===\nBlue Beetle has appeared in the \'\'[[Justice League Unlimited]]\'\' spin-off comic book, in issues #5 and #8.\n\n==In other media==\n{{See also|Blue Beetle (Dan Garrett)#In other media|Ted Kord#In other media|Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)#In other media}}\n===Television===\n* The Jaime Reyes incarnation of the Blue Beetle and Ted Kord appear in the \'\'[[Smallville]]\'\' episode "Booster", portrayed by Jaren Brandt Bartlett and [[Sebastian Spence]] respectively.\n* The Jaime Reyes, Ted Kord, and Dan Garrett incarnations of Blue Beetle appear in \'\'[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]\'\', with Reyes and Kord voiced by [[Will Friedle]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/2008/04/batman-the-brave-and-the-bold-officially-announced-images-included/ |author= Jim Harvey |title= \'Batman: The Brave and The Bold\' Officially Announced, Images Included |publisher= worldsfinestonline.com |date=April 3, 2008 |access-date= June 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/bravebold/ |title= The World\'s Finest - Batman: The Brave and the Bold |publisher= Worldsfinestonline.com |access-date= April 25, 2011}}</ref> and [[Wil Wheaton]]<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/01/wil-wheaton-tak/ |title= Wil Wheaton Takes the Blue Beetle Back to His Silver Age Roots on \'\'Batman: The Brave and the Bold\'\' |magazine= Wired |access-date=September 13, 2010 |first=Ken |last= Denmead |date= January 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1728263/|title="Batman: The Brave and the Bold" Menace of the Madniks! |date=15 October 2010 |publisher= [[Internet Movie Database]] |access-date= June 3, 2011}}</ref> respectively while Garrett is silent.
