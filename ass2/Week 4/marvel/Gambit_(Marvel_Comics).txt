The character was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Jim Lee]]. Drawn by artist [[Mike Collins (comics)|Mike Collins]], Gambit made his first appearances in \'\'[[The Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men Annual]]\'\' #14 (July 1990) and \'\'[[The Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #266 (Aug. 1990).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=144}}</ref><ref name="Marvel">[http://marvel.com/characters/19/gambit], "Marvel Characters", accessed April 9, 2015.</ref>\n\nGambit belongs to a subspecies of humans called [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who are born with superhuman abilities. Gambit has the ability to mentally create, control, and manipulate pure [[kinetic energy]] to his desire. He is also incredibly knowledgeable and skilled in [[card throwing]], [[hand-to-hand combat]], and the use of a [[bō]] staff. Gambit is known to charge [[playing card]]s and other objects with kinetic energy, using them as explosive projectiles.\n\nHe was part of a [[thieves\' guild]] before becoming a member of the X-Men. Given his history, few X-Men trusted Gambit when he joined the group. There was consistently a source of stress between him and his [[On-again, off-again relationship|on-again, off-again love interest]] and eventual wife [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]]. This was exacerbated when Gambit\'s connections to [[supervillain|villain]] [[Mister Sinister]] were revealed, although some of his team members accept that Gambit honestly seeks redemption. Often portrayed as a "ladies\' man," Gambit has shown a more vulnerable side of himself over the years, especially when it comes to Rogue. Gambit remains fiercely proud of his [[Louisiana]] heritage and speaks in a [[Cajuns|Cajun]] accent.\n\nSince his debut, Gambit has appeared in several solo series. As of 2013, there have been three attempts at an ongoing title starring the character. Gambit has also had two miniseries and starred prominently in \'\'Gambit & the X-Ternals\'\', the [[X-Force]] replacement title during the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. He has been featured in several animated series and video games based on the X-Men. Gambit made his live-action debut in the 2009 film \'\'[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]\'\', portrayed by [[Taylor Kitsch]].<ref name="MovieActor">{{Cite web|url=http://blastmagazine.com/the-magazine/entertainment/2008/07/comic-con-2008-let-there-be-gambit/|title=Comic-con 2008: Let there be Gambit|last=Schwartz|first=Teri|date=July 25, 2008 |publisher=Blast Magazine|access-date=June 2, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nAfter a brief appearance in \'\'The Uncanny X-Men Annual\'\' #14 (July 1990), Gambit\'s first major role was in \'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #266 (Aug. 1990).<ref>Warren, Jon (Oct. 1994), "Wizard Price Guide", \'\'[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]\'\', p209, Gareb S Shamus.</ref> Because the story in the annual is set after the story in #266, there is some debate among collectors about which issue is the "true" first appearance.<ref>(Sept. 29, 2014), "[http://www.comicbookdaily.com/columns/why-comics-rule/first-brief-appearance-vs-first-full-appearance-one-better/ 1st Brief Appearance Vs. 1st Full Appearance: Which Is Better?]", Comic Book Daily.

The first, which lasted 25 issues and two annuals, ran from February 1999 to February 2001. The second lasted 12 issues and ran from Nov. 2004 to Aug. 2005. The third series lasted 17 issues, from Aug. 2012 to Sept. 2013.\n\nAdditionally, \'\'Gambit & the X-Ternals\'\', published in 1995, featured a group of renegade mutants led by Gambit who has been living on the edge of law during the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. In 2009, Gambit\'s past was explored in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] \'\'X-Men Origins: Gambit\'\'. In 2010, the one-shot "Curse of the Mutants: Storm & Gambit" was released. In June 2011, he began co-starring in \'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\'.\n\nIt was announced at the C2E2 convention by Marvel Comics that in August 2012 Gambit gets his own solo series that takes him back to his roots as a charismatic, cool, mutant master thief, written by [[James Asmus]] and drawn by [[Clay Mann]].<ref>Guerrero, Tony (Aug. 7, 2012).

He was kidnapped from the hospital where he was born, then raised by the LeBeau Clan [[Thieves\' Guild]], and given to the Antiquary as a tribute.\n\nThey referred to the child as "Le Diable Blanc" ("the White Devil") and believed he was prophesied to unite the warring Thieves\' and Assassins\' Guilds. Soon after, Remy was placed in the care of Fagan\'s Mob, a gang of street thieves who raised the child and taught him the ways of thievery. After living as an orphan on the streets, a 10-year-old Remy attempted to pick the pocket of Jean-Luc LeBeau, then patriarch of the Thieves\' Guild. Jean-Luc took the boy off the streets and adopted him into his own family.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' #2 (1993)</ref>\n\nRemy\'s bio-kinetic charging abilities manifested early in his teens, although he kept his powers secret from his family and friends, practicing his powers away from prying eyes. When he was 15, he accompanied his cousin Etienne Marceaux on his "Tithing," the ritual initiation test of the Thieves\' Guild. However, it went awry as they were assigned to steal from the powerful immortal mutant [[Candra (comics)|Candra]], who quickly captured them. Candra recognized Remy from an encounter that had taken place in her past but in his future (due to a time travel mission to the 19th Century that Remy would take as an adult) and sold them to the deformed mutant gangster and child slave trader known as the Pig, who planned to sell them and others their age to [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] as boy soldiers. Remy used his powers to escape their holding pen, but the physically enhanced Pig quickly caught up to them. Remy discovered his signature attack when he picked up a playing card that Etienne had dropped, charged it, and threw it in the Pig\'s face, taking out his eye. Finally escaping his clifftop headquarters by diving into the sea, Remy was ultimately rescued by the Guild; Etienne drowned.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 3 #6 (1999)</ref>\n\nLater during his teen years, Remy was first hired by [[Mister Sinister]], then in the disguise of Dr. Nathaniel Essex. Essex wanted his stolen diaries back from the [[Weapon X]] program. Remy and the Thieves\' Guild accepted the mission and sent out Remy to retrieve said diaries. Standing in the cold, scouting the Weapon X facility, Remy could not bear the cold and swore he would steal a long, stylish jacket in New Orleans after the mission, which he did. Upon entering the facility, Remy witnessed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] escaping from his [[adamantium]] procedure and found the diaries. However, deeming them to be too dangerous for Essex to have them, as Remy did not fully trust him, Remy burned the diaries. He headed back home, only to find a disappointed Thieves\' Guild and Essex.<ref>\'\'Weapon X: First Class\'\' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to reconcile the Thieves\' and Assassins\' Guilds, Remy married [[Bella Donna Boudreaux]], granddaughter of the head Assassin, whom he met at the age of eight. Unfortunately, he was challenged by her brother Julien to a duel after the wedding. In the duel, Gambit killed Julien, and he was exiled from the city, ending his romantic relationship with Bella Donna.<ref>\'\'X-Men Origins: Gambit\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===The Mutant Massacre===\nAfter his exile from New Orleans, he wandered the world and became a master professional thief, making many contacts (and quite a few enemies). During this period, Gambit found he had an uncontrollable amount of energy flowing through him, to the point that he could not withstand it. Desperate, Gambit went to [[Mister Sinister]] for help. Sinister modified Gambit\'s power by removing a portion of Gambit\'s brain stem, making him significantly less powerful, but able to control the still considerably large amount of power in him.<ref>\'\'X-Men Origins: Gambit\'\' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Years later, a much younger version of Mister Sinister surgically returned it, upon Gambit\'s request, when Gambit time-traveled to the 19th century.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 3 #12–14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHowever, Sinister wanted the favor returned, so Gambit carried out various missions for him. For the last of these operations, Gambit gathered together a group of mercenaries which Sinister named the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Mister Sinister then ordered Gambit to lead [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Blockbuster (Marvel Comics)|Blockbuster]], [[Prism (comics)|Prism]], and [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]] into the tunnels under New York City — while unknown to Gambit however — Mister Sinister had also ordered [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]], [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]], [[Malice (comics)#Malice|Malice]], [[Scrambler (comics)|Scrambler]] and [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)#Vertigo|Vertigo]] into the tunnels. The group of Scalphunter followed the Morlock [[Tommy (comics)|Tommy]] and their goal was to wipe out the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]]. Gambit was unable to prevent the Marauders from killing a considerable number of Morlocks, but he was able to save a single child named Sarah, who would grow up to be [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], the leader of the mutant terrorist group [[Gene Nation]]. Gambit long kept his involvement with Mister Sinister and his mission in the massacre a secret from his fellow X-Men, much to their eventual displeasure.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #350">\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #350.

Gambit was able to triumph by using a robotic doppelganger of [[Lady Deathstrike]] to distract Wolverine while taking advantage of Wolverine\'s injuries, inflicted by the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]].<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #273. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gambit and the X-Men were then taken to the [[Shi\'ar]] galaxy by [[Lila Cheney]]. Alongside the X-Men and [[Starjammers]], Gambit battled [[Deathbird]], the [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]], and a band of [[Skrull|Warskrulls]].<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #274–277.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen the original five X-Men rejoined and the team was divided into two squads, Gambit became part of the Blue team under [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]\' leadership.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nGambit became romantically interested in one of his teammates, [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]], and started flirting with her. Despite her off-putting manner and the obstacle of her uncontrollable mutant ability that prevented anyone from touching her, he began romancing and seducing Rogue.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Their strong romantic relationship was originally written as a one time, flirtatious moment; ironically, their romantic relationship is listed as one of the longest and most popular on-going deep and close romantic relationships in the X-Men series, probably only second to [[Jean Grey]] and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://comicsbulletin.com/marvel-top-ten-romances/|title=Marvel Top Ten: Romances: Silver Soapbox|last=Powers|first=Kevin|publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]]|access-date=2009-06-05}}</ref> Although their early "courtship" portrayed him as very "devil may care" in his flirtation with her, later issues revealed that, beneath his bravado and swagger, he truly had genuine romantic feelings for her. Similarly, despite her initial aggressive rejection of his advances, Rogue found that she was not only flattered by his attention but that she felt equally romantically attracted to him.\n\nMany publishing years later, it had become apparent Remy had a dark secret. [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] had hinted to it on numerous occasions during his "residency" at the [[X-Mansion]], prompting Rogue to ask him to reveal whatever he knew about Gambit\'s past.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #28</ref> Remy was captured and brought before a mock trial held by Magneto, the mutant Master of Magnetism, disguised as [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]].<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #350" /> Rogue was forced to kiss him again, revealing that he had gathered information on the Morlocks and assembled the team of [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] for Mr. Sinister who did not inform Remy of his ultimate intent for the mutant tribe. When the Marauders later began killing most of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], it was revealed that Gambit saved a single girl from the Marauders during the massacre. This apparent revelation and absorbing Gambit\'s own guilty memories caused Rogue to reject him. Gambit was similarly cast out of the X-Men and was abandoned in the frozen wastes of [[Antarctica]].<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #350 (Dec. 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nStarving, and haunted by the betrayal of his lover, Gambit made his way back into Magneto\'s citadel, where he encountered the psionic essence of a dead mutant named Mary Purcell.<ref>\'\'Gambit Annual\'\' \'99</ref> The wraith-like Mary bonded with him, allowing him to survive until he reached the [[Savage Land]], a hidden jungle nestled in the icy wasteland. There, Remy struck a deal with an enigmatic being known as the [[Alternative versions of Gambit#New Son (Sun)|New Son]].<ref>\'\'Gambit Wizard Special\'\' #1/2</ref> In exchange for passage back to America, Gambit agreed to run errands with the help of friend Jacob Gavin Jr.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 2 #1</ref> During this period, Remy\'s command over his abilities strengthened and amplified significantly.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 2 #2</ref>\n\nWhen Gambit\'s psyche absorption had worn off, Rogue spent months searching for him, to no avail. Gambit encountered [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] when he attempted to steal the fabled [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak]] for his new employer.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #361</ref> He agreed to return to the X-Men, mainly for his self-respect and for Rogue. At one point, he became the field leader of a branch of X-Men. His romantic love for Rogue was still intact, but her inability to control her powers made her break it off out of fear of hurting him.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #381</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the New Son revealed his true identity as an alternate universe version of Gambit himself, after organizing an assassination game for a cadre of superpowered mercenaries with Remy as the target.<ref>\'\'Gambit Annual\'\' 2000</ref> During the final confrontation, Gambit burned out his enhanced abilities, thus returning to his original level of power.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 2 #24</ref>\n\n===Bishop\'s future===\nIn [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]\'s future timeline, Bishop stumbles upon a video from the past with [[Jean Grey]] making a frantic call to any X-Men she can find. She says that the X-Men have been betrayed by "one of their own" and it appears in the video that she is the last one left and is killed in the video. Disturbed by this, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] seeks "[[Alternative versions of Gambit#Bishop\'s future|The Witness]]", a man who is said to be the last person who has ever seen the X-Men of the past alive. He enters a citadel of sorts where he confronts an old and withered but plucky man with long gray hair sitting on a throne, with two blonde women to either side of him. When Bishop confronts him as to who killed the X-Men the Witness acts as though he knows but refuses to tell and Bishop is thrown out of the citadel.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #287</ref>\n\nWhen Bishop comes to the X-Men in their [[Earth-616|original timeline]], he meets Gambit and is sure that he is the same old man in Bishop\'s future and that it was Gambit who was the "Traitor" that killed the X-Men. For some time, he continues to watch Gambit\'s every step until he is finally convinced sometime later that Gambit was not the Traitor (with [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] being revealed to be the traitor). The reason behind Gambit being called the Witness in Bishop\'s timeline has not been revealed. In the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]], it was revealed that the Witness was killed by the Marauders in their efforts to destroy anyone with knowledge of the future.{{issue|date=February 2014}}\n\n===2000s===\n\n====X-Treme X-Men: XSE====\nWhen Storm leads a team of X-Men in search of [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny\'s]] diaries, the thirteen-volume [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Books of Truth]], Gambit volunteered to join them, but Rogue — afraid that her increasingly uncontrolled powers would bring him harm — flatly refused to allow him along. He returned to thievery instead and was soon after framed by mutant businessman [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] for the death of the [[Australia]]n crime lord named Viceroy. With the assistance of Rogue, Storm\'s team of [[X-Treme X-Men]], and former [[Triad (underground societies)|Triad]] member [[Red Lotus (comics)|Red Lotus]], Gambit was able to clear his name. Soon after, Remy was captured and his powers were used to open a portal intended for an alien invasion of Earth led by the interdimensional warlord [[Khan (comics)|Khan]].<ref>\'\'X-Treme X-Men\'\' #1–17</ref>\n\nThe X-Treme team\'s enemy, the enhanced human named [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]], used the invasion as a chance to attempt to kill more of Storm\'s team, particularly Rogue who was depicted by Destiny as slaying him. Rogue\'s attempt at rescuing and shielding Gambit got her stuck and Vargas used the opportunity to impale them both. Gambit was seriously wounded, but [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]\'s surgical skills and Rogue\'s pleading with Gambit on the astral plane, resulted in both surviving their ordeal. As they lost their mutant powers, they decided to sort out their romantic relationship by retiring from the X-Men temporarily and moving to California.<ref>\'\'X-Treme X-Men\'\' #18–19</ref>\n\nAlthough he is powerless, Gambit later joins [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] in infiltrating the US President\'s Texan ranch for obtaining information on a closed-group meeting proposing worldwide policies on mutants.<ref>\'\'X-Treme X-Men\'\' #31</ref>\n\n====Rejoining the team====\nGambit and [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]] rejoined the X-Men soon after [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] jump-started their powers, and they were placed on [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]\'s team. In their first mission back, Gambit was temporarily blinded by one of his energized cards that went off by his face.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #158 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> Rogue tried to console Gambit during his recovery, but their romantic relationship became strained once more as he became more and more frustrated with his blindness and their lack of touch after Rogue\'s powers returned. He started lashing out at Rogue, most of the time verbally. As a result, Rogue took some time away from Gambit.<ref>\'\'Rogue\'\' #1-6 (2004). Marvel Comics.</ref> While he lost his vision, Gambit developed an ability to read his playing cards like they were [[tarot]] cards and he was able to predict the attack by the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #164 (2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> A little while later, during [[Christmas]] celebrations, Rogue asked Sage to once again jumpstart Gambit\'s powers, in the process, healing his vision.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #165 (Feb. 2005)</ref>\n\nDuring the story arc with Golgotha, Gambit revealed some deep insecurities he had about his romantic relationship with Rogue, saying that "Maybe dis no-touching thing is getting to me... more den I thought".<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #167. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also told Rogue that she should just get together with Logan, thinking that there was a hidden attraction between the two. As a result of the accusation, [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] kissed Rogue, but she broke it off before it caused any major damage. Gambit then began to realize what he was saying, questioning his romantic love for Rogue, but soon after began to suffer from hallucinations that he was fighting [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #169. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Rogue and Gambit soon realized that Golgotha made them say things they did not mean and before the final battle, they "kissed" through their spacesuit helmets.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #170. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOnce back at the mansion, Gambit and Rogue moved into the same room to try rebuilding some intimacy and began telepathic therapy with [[Emma Frost]]. {{issue|date=May 2012}} They soon found out that with all the [[emotional baggage]] going on in their minds, they were still unable to make physical contact mentally.{{issue|date=May 2012}} This would cause even more strain when the new student, Foxx, joins Gambit\'s team and attempts to seduce him.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #171. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Horseman of Apocalypse====\n[[File:GambitDeath.png|thumb|right|150px|Gambit as the Horseman of Death. Art by [[Salvador Larroca]].]]\nRogue\'s foster mother [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] was displeased with Rogue\'s choice of lovers and infiltrated Xavier\'s Institute by [[shapeshifting]] into a student called Foxx. She joined Gambit\'s squad in an attempt to ruin his relationship with Rogue. After Gambit resisted her charms, Mystique reverted to her true form and then offered Gambit something significantly more difficult to refuse: she transformed into Rogue and offered Gambit a Rogue with whom he could have a physical relationship, claiming that she was only trying to help relieve the increasing frustrations between the two lovers; "... if one of you could have some physical release...". Rogue eventually discovered her mother\'s presence in the school and that Gambit knew she was there. Gambit denies that he slept with Mystique.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #174. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUpon the return of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], Gambit submitted himself to the villain and was transformed into one of Apocalypse\'s [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen]], Death. Gambit intended to infiltrate himself into Apocalypse\'s ranks in order to protect the X-Men from the Dark Lord\'s eventual betrayal, but he miscalculated, as the transformation process warped his mind as well as his body. After becoming Death, Gambit\'s hair turned white and his skin turned deep black. Despite having his mind and body twisted, Gambit retained a large portion of his former self, stating to Apocalypse, "I\'m both Death and Gambit", and he also remembered his love for Rogue as he could not bring himself to kill her. Gambit and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] then returned to the Xavier Institute to claim [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]. Gambit, in an attempt to free all ties with his old self, tried to kill Rogue and would have been successful had it not been for [[Pulse (X-Men)|Pulse]] neutralizing Gambit\'s powers.{{issue|date=February 2014}}\n\nAfter the X-Men defeated Apocalypse, Sunfire left with Gambit to help him clear Apocalypse\'s brainwashing and live as entirely new beings, only to then be approached by [[Mister Sinister]].{{issue|date=February 2014}}\n\n==== Marauders ====\nGambit returned to his original appearance and powers (presumably with the aid of Mr. Sinister) and reemerged as a member of the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #200. Marvel Comics.</ref> On a mission for Mr. Sinister (involving obtaining knowledge of the future) Gambit and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] encountered [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] on the recently evacuated island of Providence. Before the fight Gambit said, "I dropped that whole new look, wit\' the help of a friend." He then asked Cable for use of his super-computer to answer a question referring to the phrase "one minute before dawn," which tied into the then-upcoming [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]] storyline. As a result, Gambit and Sunfire attacked him eventually forcing Cable to activate a self-destruct sequence destroying the entire island.<ref name="Cable and Deadpool #42">\'\'Cable and Deadpool\'\' #42. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gambit and Sunfire escaped empty-handed.\n\nDuring the fight, Cable noted that Gambit\'s accent sounded \'forced\' either for comic effect or perhaps to indicate that things may not be as \'back to normal\' as they seem with Gambit.<ref name="Cable and Deadpool #42" /> As Gambit returned to Mr. Sinister\'s base to discuss the next step of the plan, he reprimanded Mystique for shooting Rogue when they abducted her, being placated only by Mr. Sinister\'s assurance that Rogue was still needed and would survive. In a recent confrontation with [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], he seemed to sympathize with a beaten Cannonball. He interfered when [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]] was about to kill Cannonball by attacking Cannonball and by his actions he was able to save Cannonball from certain death. At the same time, he also destroyed [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]\'s diaries, preventing Sinister and the Marauders from getting them.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #202. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Messiah Complex====\nDuring the 2007–2008 "[[Messiah Complex (comics)|Messiah Complex]]" storyline, Gambit is personally targeted by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] during the X-Men\'s assault on [[Mister Sinister]]\'s Antarctic base.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #205</ref> After being tortured by the Canadian mutant, Gambit reveals that [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] has the baby before Sinister manages to regain the advantage and drive the X-Men off with Gambit later revealed not to be harmed. Later, as Bishop attempts to kill the baby (after immobilizing Cable), Gambit and several of the Marauders quickly stop him with Gambit bringing a section of the ceiling down on Bishop. Knowing the X-Men will arrive in moments, the Marauders depart with the baby, but not before Gambit ponders what could make Bishop turn on the X-Men.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #494. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTracking Gambit using [[Cerebro]], the X-Men find that the Marauders\' hideout was on [[Muir Island]]. However, what they did not know is that Gambit let them track him. It appears that Gambit, along with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], has plans of their own for the newborn mutant as evidenced by his lack of surprise when he delivered the baby to Sinister, who then reveals himself to be Mystique as the real Sinister lies on the floor with shock etched into his face, and the fact that Mystique told Gambit that it is time for the next step.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nA flashback sequence shows that Mystique used Rogue\'s intensified powers to kill Sinister. In the present, she explains that everything she and Gambit have done has led to this moment as foretold by Destiny. Mystique touches the baby\'s face to Rogue\'s in the hope of sacrificing the child to save her. After an energy burst Gambit snatches the baby, saying that Rogue would never want an innocent life used to save hers. However, the child was unharmed by Rogue\'s touch. Gambit gives the baby to Xavier and says he wishes to stay with Rogue. Shortly after, Rogue awakens and tries to kill Mystique. However, somehow the baby cures her of her intensified powers, as well as any psyches she had ever absorbed; this leaves her with the psyche of only one other individual: Mystique. She tells Gambit she needs time alone and if he still cares for her, he would not follow.<ref>\'\'New X-Men\'\' #46. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #207. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===="Divided We Stand"====\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\nIn the 2008 "[[X-Men: Divided We Stand|Divided We Stand]]" storyline, Gambit, received news that the Assassins Guild of New Orleans was approached to kill [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], goes to track Xavier down and save him from possible danger. He manages to head off Xavier\'s attackers, defeating them in short order before he is joined by Xavier himself. They determine who the Assassins were supposed to kill next from a list Gambit pulls from one of the goons, which includes [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], and Carter Ryking (Hazard). Xavier makes the connection between himself, Ryking, and Juggernaut, but is at a loss with Shaw. They go to see Ryking, who was being held in a mental institution, only to find out that he had just died of a brain hemorrhage the night before.{{issue|date=February 2014}}\n\nGambit and Xavier then drive out to the Nuclear Research Facility at [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]], the place where the fathers of Xavier, Juggernaut, and Ryking all worked at some point in their lives and is most likely where Mister Sinister was running his genetic operations on the X-gene. However, Xavier begins to suffer terrible headaches, and he and Gambit decide to wait it out in the desert for a few hours, where they are once again attacked by the Assassins Guild.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #212. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCharles Xavier is abducted and taken to the Almagordo facility, where it is revealed that the employer of the assassins was Amanda Mueller, the head of the Black Womb Project, a former lover and protégée of Mister Sinister (as well as direct ancestress of the Summers\' line), who plans to use Charles to activate Sinister\'s Cronus machine, so as to be able to revive herself with Essex\'s own superpowered essence. Meanwhile, Gambit manages to defeat the rest of the assassins with the assistance of Sebastian Shaw, and they form a temporary alliance of convenience to destroy the Cronus machine, which threatens Shaw as well and rescue Xavier. They ultimately manage to succeed with a desperate last-minute life-or-death gamble when Gambit directly charges Shaw with biokinetic energy, giving him enough power to utterly shatter the otherwise indestructible machine.{{issue|date=February 2014}}\n\nHe begins searching [[Australia]] for Rogue and is again in the company of Professor Xavier.<ref name="XL220">\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #220 (March 2009)</ref> Gambit, however, is unsure of this venture, mainly because of Rogue\'s request that she be left alone. He and Xavier both agreed that if Rogue did not wish for their help or presence, they would do as she wished and leave her be.<ref name="XL220" />\n\nWhen Gambit and Xavier make it over the plains, they find a completely mismatched landscape. Fearing it is Rogue\'s doing, they go in and find various parts of Rogue\'s past being projected around them, including her fight against [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] and being captured and beaten at Genosha. Gambit finds it hard to control his emotions seeing Rogue in so much pain, but Xavier reminds him that none of it is real. While in the [[Genosha]] prison cells, Gambit and Xavier find the [[Shi\'ar]] parts hunters and they are told what is happening. They discover that Danger is the one causing the projections and is using Rogue\'s input from [[Danger Room]] sessions. Xavier decides it is better to find Danger first, coming to the conclusion that Danger is trying to push Rogue to some sort of realization.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #222. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nEventually, Xavier, Gambit and a group of Shi\'ar pirates managed to shut down Danger. However, the Professor reactivates her and she defeats the pirates in turn when they attack Gambit and Xavier. After this, it is revealed that Rogue\'s powers never truly developed past their initial "nascent" stage, which was the reason why her powers never functioned properly. The Professor, now aware of this fact, uses his telepathy to tear down the mental walls that kept Rogue\'s powers from developing as well as removing the mental echo of Mystique. Finally Rogue kisses Gambit, with no ill side effects, revealing that she is in control of her absorption power.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #224. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Utopia===\nGambit along with Rogue and Danger decides to go to San Francisco in order to regroup with the other X-Men. On their way there they are intercepted by Pixie who teleports them into the city which is in a state of chaos due to the anti-mutant and pro-mutant movements. Cyclops sends all three out in order to locate several missing students and bring them home. Gambit locates [[Trance (comics)|Trance]], [[Dragoness (comics)|Dragoness]] and Toad who are being pursued by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]] and [[Onyxx]] appear and take Trance away for safety.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #226. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater on he encounters [[Erg (comics)|Erg]] and [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]] who attacks Ares. Gambit intervenes only to end up being swatted aside by [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]. Danger and Rogue come to his aid which eventually leads to Rogue absorbing Ares\'s powers. Gambit then blasts him unconscious. Having for the moment absorbed some of Ares\'s power, Rogue easily dispatches a small group of H.A.M.M.E.R. agents and proceeds to steal their tank, along with Gambit and Danger, in order to find the rest of the students and [[Trance (comics)|Trance]] who did not make it back to base. Trance appears to be lost in the city and under the attack of Ms. Marvel from the [[Dark Avengers]] team. Gambit, Rogue and Danger team-up to defeat the powerful female warrior, and Rogue eventually manages to calm Trance down. Remy, Rogue, and Danger then depart back to the X-Men\'s base.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #227. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the battle between the X-Men and the Dark Avengers is over, Cyclops orders Gambit to destroy the Omega Machine chair that Osborn had built to neutralize mutant powers. Gambit makes his way into the H.A.M.M.E.R. headquarters. There, he fights H.A.M.M.E.R.\'s mutate guards Hijack and Input. Hijack is easily defeated, however, Input is another story. The input uses his telepathic abilities to enter Gambit\'s head and discovers there are still left-overs from Remy\'s "Death" persona. Death re-emerges and defeats Input, and absorbed him into a playing card, which turns black upon doing so. Afterward, Remy somehow returns to normal, with a smile on his face. Gambit then completes his mission, destroys the chair, and returns to the X-Men.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy Annual\'\' #1 (2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> When he made it back to Utopia, Gambit got angry at Cyclops for letting Rogue go up against the villain Emplate all alone. Remy tried to argue with Cyclops, but suddenly got trouble with mood swings and left the group. He changed back into his Death persona and remembered how Apocalypse told him he would never be the same after undergoing the changing process. Gambit managed to calm himself down and transform back to his normal self, but he is worried about his condition.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #229 (2010).

Things go wrong when the ground starts to tremble and an army of monstrous demons attack the team. Dazzler calls upon Gambit for help during the attack, but Gambit sinks into the darkness, claiming "Remy\'s not home right now" leading the X-Men to be overwhelmed by the demons and Gambit transforming into his Death persona.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Second Coming – Revelations: Hellbound\'\' #1 (2010).

He prefers to charge smaller objects, such as his ever-present playing cards, as the time required to charge them is greatly reduced and they are much easier for him to throw. The only real limitation to this ability is the time required to charge the object: the larger it is the more time it takes to charge.<ref name="TUXM266"/> Most charging takes place through direct skin contact. The power of his explosions is dependent on the mass of the object he is charging: for example, a charged playing card explodes with the force of a grenade.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' Vol 3 #16</ref> Gambit can also use his mutant abilities to accelerate an object\'s kinetic energy instead of converting its potential energy;<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' Vol 5 #17</ref> for example, he can charge his Bo staff with enough kinetic energy and power to level a house.\n\nGambit\'s ability to tap into kinetic energy also grants him incredible superhuman physical attributes (strength, speed, reflexes and reactions, agility, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance),<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' Vol 3 #6</ref><ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' Vol 3 #25</ref><ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' (Vol. 3) #17-19</ref> as his body constantly generates bio-kinetic energy and so is perfectly constructed for constant motion. This gives him an added edge that he has used to his advantage by developing a unique acrobatic fighting style.\n\nThe charged potential energy always in his body grants him the ability to build up charges of static electricity, and shields his mind from detection and intrusion by even the strongest and most powerful telepaths such as [[Emma Frost]], [[Jean Grey]], and even [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]]. The shield has the added effect of destabilizing touch-based abilities.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' Vol 3 #8</ref>\n\nGambit also possesses an unusually strong and irresistible hypnotic charm that allows him to exert a subtle influence over sentient beings, leading them to believe what he says and agree with his suggestions. This charm is so strong and powerful that if given a chance, Gambit could even charm the [[Shadow King]] himself.<ref name="TUXM266">\'\'The Uncanny X-men\'\' #266</ref> The hypnotic charm does not work on those who know about it.<ref>\'\'Rogue\'\' vol. 3 #4</ref>\n\nDuring combat, Gambit customarily wears a suit of highly articulated light [[bulletproof vest|body armor]] and uses an extendable metal [[Stick-fighting|staff]]. He is extensively trained in martial arts, particularly [[Savate]]<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 3 #16 (May 2000)</ref> and the staff style art [[Bōjutsu]]. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, applying street-fighting techniques and acrobatics. Gambit is a skilled [[card-throwing|card-thrower]], so he throws his charged [[playing card]]s at opponents with great accuracy. He also excels in all aspects of thievery, as he was adopted by the patriarch of a Thieves Guild.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 3 #1 (Feb. 1999)</ref>\n\nGambit was temporarily given the full strength and potential of his mutant abilities to battle his counterpart, New Son.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 3 #14-16 (2001)</ref> At his full strength and power, Gambit can control all aspects of kinetic energy down even to the molecular level, allowing him to manipulate the potency of his bio-kinetic energy to burn, cause molecular discomfort, incinerate, create timed detonations (and manipulate the potency of the energy release), fire energy blasts, defy gravity, heal wounds, charge objects within his line of sight without contact, manipulate the flow of time & space and effectively exist as an energy being. Under such conditions, he holds sufficient power to cause another being to be unable to move—or unable to stop if in motion. He has been able to cause or simulate various energies by manipulating the kinetic energy present, such as infrared and microwaves, by increasing molecular agitation, or cold by reducing it. He was also able to use his powers to travel through space-time, cross dimensions, and remake realities outside of space-time by transforming himself into living energy which joined with the kinetic flow.<ref>\'\'Gambit Annual\'\' vol. 3 #2000 (Oct. 2000)</ref> Finally, Gambit was able to heal himself by stimulating his cellular activity.<ref>\'\'Gambit Annual\'\' vol. 3 #1 (July 1999)</ref> These enhanced powers were burnt out after fighting New Son,<ref name="Gambit\' 2001">\'\'Gambit\'\' vol 3 #24 (January 2001)</ref> and Gambit has since returned to his original, somewhat lower power levels.<ref name="Gambit\' 2001"/>\n\nHowever, after Sage jump-started his powers again, he was able to heal his blinded eyes.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #165 (Feb. 2005)</ref> —thus implying he is again able to heal himself—and is also able again to charge living things with energy,<ref>\'\'Daken: Dark Wolverine\'\' #8 2011</ref> as when he teamed up with Sebastian Shaw to destroy Mr. Sinister\'s machines.<ref>\'\'X-Men Legacy\'\' #211-214 2008</ref> He was also given another boost when he was killed in an altercation with a drug lord and [[Faiza Hussain]] managed to restore him before it set in, enabling him to charge a bullet with twice as much explosive force than usual.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 5 #17</ref> He has later proven able to delay his explosions again, although this is difficult for him to accomplish.<ref>\'\'Mr. and Mrs. X\'\' #12 (Aug. 2019)</ref>\n\nAfter Apocalypse used the Celestial Technology to transform Gambit into the Horseman Death, Gambit demonstrates the ability to convert inert materials into toxic substances (such as transforming breathable air into poisonous gases) and has the potential to ingest diseases and plagues.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #185</ref> It is apparent that the Celestial Technology never left his system, as seen during a telepathic attack against him that temporarily brought out the Death persona, which eventually killed the attacker. He also showcased new abilities he had not used before in this form – such as his Death Charge, which fueled his projectiles with dark energies that have the effect of either disintegrating or entrapping beings within his cards. His new transformation also affords him the ability to control the trajectory in which the thrown cards fly in, giving him more control over their vector path while in motion.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy Annual\'\' #1</ref> He could also convert people to his mindset like he did with [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] and several demons while in limbo.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Hellbound\'\' #2 (June 2010)</ref> Gambit\'s body did subsequently return to normal, suggesting that Gambit now has the ability to switch between his own and Death appearances.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #229</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nChris Killian of \'\'[[ComicBook.com]]\'\' referred to Gambit as one of the "best X-Men mutants," writing, "It’s really hard to have a “10 Best” X-Men mutants list and not include the Ragin’ Cajun.

Since first appearing in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #266, Gambit has consistently remained one of the more popular members of the team, yet he’s always floundered a bit on attempts to go out on his own.

Like his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, Gambit too fell in love with [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]], which prompted him to leave the X-Men when Rogue chose Magneto, whom she could touch due to the two possessing magnetism-based powers (she had permanently absorbed the powers and memories of [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Polaris]] just as she had done to [[Ms. Marvel]] on Earth-616). Gambit, as a member of the Thieves Guild, maintained a certain connection with [[Candra (comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Candra]], who was also one of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]], until she was killed. Despite having left the X-Men, Gambit still fought for "the Dream" in his own way. He assembled a group of thieves which he named "[[Externals|X-Ternals]]", who stole from Apocalypse\'s regime and the mutant aristocracy to provide food and medicines to the humans still living in New York. He also had an affair with [[Lila Cheney#Age of Apocalypse|Lila Cheney]], despite the fact that he had not gotten over Rogue.<ref>\'\'Gambit and the X-Ternals\'\' #1</ref>\n\nWhen Magneto put into action his plan to save [[Charles Xavier]], Gambit agreed to steal a shard of the [[M\'Kraan Crystal]] with the aid of his X-Ternals. Gambit and the X-Ternals were chased by Mudir [[Rictor (comics)|Rictor]] and later faced the [[Shi\'ar]]. However, Gambit obtained the shard of the Crystal, giving up in exchange for it his undying love for Rogue. Gambit thought that he had now lost his ability to love. The group returned to Earth; however, Gambit lost both the Crystal shard and Magneto and Rogue\'s son, Charles, to the traitor [[Strong Guy#Age of Apocalypse|Guido]] when he threatened to kill Lila.<ref>\'\'Gambit and the X-Ternals\'\' #2-4</ref>\n\nDespite this, Gambit was accepted back into the X-Men when they launched a mission to get into Apocalypse\'s citadel to rescue Magneto and put his plan into action. Gambit killed the crazed [[Alternative versions of Colossus#Age of Apocalypse|Colossus]] when his desire to save his sister [[Magik (comics)|Illyana]] threatened the mission.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Omega\'\'</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Apocalypse and the fall of his regime, Gambit once again became a member of the X-Men.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Age of Apocalypse\'\' #1</ref>\n\nDuring the AoA\'s 10th anniversary, Gambit was part of the X-Men and helped Magneto eliminate the remaining forces still loyal to Apocalypse. This included helping the X-Men get rid of the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]]. Magneto later became injured while telling the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] that they were free, and when he was recuperating, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] detected mutant signatures of Apocalypse\'s former soldiers in Mexico. Magneto then left with Quicksilver, Gambit, and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]].<ref>\'\'X-Men: Age of Apocalypse\'\' #3</ref>\n\nThe Guthrie siblings later attacked the X-Men\'s base, taking Rogue and Charles Lensherr captive. Magneto, Sunfire, Gambit, and Quicksilver returned to the base and defeated the Guthries. Magneto then revealed his secret regarding Sinister, leading the X-Men to [[Mister Sinister|Sinister]]\'s lab in New York. The X-Men then fought the [[Sinister Six]], and during the fight, Gambit, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] were sucked into [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]]. Nightcrawler managed to save Dazzler, but not Gambit, resulting in Gambit\'s presumed death, though it was not confirmed. The X-Men later buried their dead and created a tombstone for Gambit whose full text is not seen, but ending in "... luck always be on his side."<ref>\'\'X-Men: Age of Apocalypse\'\' #6</ref>\n\nHowever, it appears that luck was indeed at Gambit\'s side after all, as he was rescued in time from the Darkforce Dimension at some point and was greeted by the X-Men team later.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' #12</ref> When the X-Force team of Earth-616 came to the Age of Apocalypse to retrieve a Celestial life seed to prevent Warren to ascend as the new Apocalypse, Gambit was part of the Fantomex team to retrieve the seed from the deceased Celestial and he gives his life so the team could retrieve the object from the cosmic being.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' #13</ref>\n\n===Bishop\'s future===\nIn the future timeline that is the home of the X-Man [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] (Earth-1191), the X-Men were wiped out in 1996 by someone recorded only as [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|\'The X-Traitor\']]. However, there was apparently one survivor of the attack, a man called "\'\'\'The Witness\'\'\'." He had a Cajun accent and long hair. He and Bishop had an antagonistic relationship at that time. When Bishop came to the past, he recognized Gambit\'s face as that of the Witness.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #4</ref>\n\nLater, the Witness was revealed to have been living happily in New Orleans, unchanged from how Bishop will know him in 80 years\' time. He met the young Remy Lebeau, and had a set of trophies from countless battles across time (fans noticed [[Captain America]]\'s shattered shield, the red power suit from [[The Greatest American Hero]], and [[Hellboy]]\'s [[Hellboy#Right Hand of Doom|Right Hand of Doom]]). He claimed to be pantemporal, capable of seeing all things in all realities at all times. The fact that he was even capable of conversing with Bishop or anyone else in a linear fashion is apparently due to his sense of humor.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #200</ref>\n\n===Exiles===\n{{Main|Exiles (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n[[File:Gambit in Exiles.jpg|Gambit in Weapon X|thumb|right|200px]]\n\nIn \'\'[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]\'\', Gambit of Earth-371 was the team leader of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]] (the ruthless counterpart to the heroic Exiles), having replaced Sabretooth. With Weapon X they had to work with [[Iron Man]], the fascist monarch of Earth, to kill all of the [[Inhumans]]. They succeeded and went to the next reality.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #23</ref><ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #25</ref>\n\nIt appeared that he and Storm on his team had been in a relationship and that back in his alternative reality he and Storm (another one from his alternative reality) were married. Storm was now dead and replaced by [[Hyperion (comics)#Exiles|Hyperion]]. In this mission, Weapon X was supposed to kill the ten remaining mutants in this reality, but this evil version of Hyperion wanted to be the ruler of this Earth. The heroes did not want to murder anyone, but a battle with Hyperion soon followed. Hyperion shot off Gambit\'s arm, forcing Gambit to retreat into the Morlock tunnels. Hyperion murdered most of the Weapon X team.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #38</ref><ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #40</ref><ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #43</ref><ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #45</ref>\n\nFinally, the Exiles appeared and determined the true nature of the mission although they initially refused to go through with it. They were to kill six members of Weapon X and the Exiles. Hyperion and an evil version of [[Ms. Marvel#Exiles|Ms. Marvel]] (who had already taken care of most of the killing) forced them to fight. In the end, Hyperion was \'\'seemingly\'\' killed by Gambit after [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] had injured him sufficiently to make him vulnerable. Gambit was disintegrated in the blast. It was revealed later that Hyperion resurrected himself and took control of the Panoptichron. It was also revealed that every Weapon X and Exiles team member who died or was sent home were frozen into a crystal wall in that palace. When the Exiles found the place, there were many fallen heroes—-Gambit among them. Gambit\'s body is returned to his home dimension for burial in.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #83</ref>\n\n====New Exiles====\nIn \'\'New Exiles\'\' #2-4, a very different version of Gambit was shown. Still called Remy, attracted to Rogue and sometimes speaking approximate Cajun, this version was the son of [[Namor#Exiles|Namor]] and [[Sue Storm#Exiles|Sue Storm]]. He has four siblings and the power to breathe underwater as well as the force field projection capabilities of his mother. He saved Rogue when she was injured and drowning to her death. He was then flown by her to his family, which they saved together.<ref>\'\'New Exiles\'\' #2</ref> He then went on to join the Exiles team.<ref>\'\'New Exiles\'\' #4</ref>\n\n===House of M===\nGambit makes a brief appearance in House of M as a thief being caught by [[Carol Danvers]].<ref>\'\'House of M\'\' #2</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nA zombie Gambit is seen as one of the dozens of super-powered zombies attacking [[Doctor Doom]]\'s castle trying to reach the uninfected humans inside. This is after being seen on [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\'s [[helicarrier]] between Colossus and Magneto. This takes place in \'\'[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]\'\'. In \'\'[[Marvel Zombies]] #3\'\', Gambit is one of the many zombies trying to slay and eat the [[Silver Surfer]]. Next, Gambit\'s chest is blasted through, then his head, from the jaw up, is knocked off, by the cosmically powered zombies.<ref>\'\'Marvel Zombies\'\' #3</ref>\n\n===Mutant X===\nIn the Mutant X universe, Gambit was in a fatal accident when he was attempting to save his foster daughter.<ref name="Mutant X #16">\'\'Mutant X\'\' #16</ref>\n\nHe was accompanied by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)#Other versions|Bloodstorm]] at the time and begged her to turn him into a [[vampire]] so that he didn\'t have to die. She reluctantly accepted his request and became Gambit\'s sire. He was very unhappy with the creature he had become, blaming Bloodstorm for what she had done to him, and ran away.<ref name="Mutant X #16" />\n\nSince his eyes were naturally red, no one in the Thieves\' Guild noticed any difference in Gambit, only making it easier for him to continue to feed. For a time, Gambit worked to prevent Bloodstorm from feeding on sentient beings, such as the thieving Marauders and otherwise innocent vampire-wannabes. Later, Gambit was forced to join [[Havok (comics)|Havok\'s]] team [[Mutant X (comics)|The Six]], and while there, received a partial cure for his vampirism from the [[Beast (comics)#Other versions|Brute]]. With the [[blood plasma|serum]] he devised, it granted both Gambit and Bloodstorm a reprieve from their blood lust and gave them the ability to walk in the sunlight. However, Gambit\'s appreciation did not run deep. When the team was in crisis-fighting the combined might of the [[Madelyne Pryor#Mutant X|Goblyn Force]], [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Count Dracula]], and the [[Beyonder]], Gambit stole the team\'s jet and flew away with his adopted daughter Raven, never to be seen again.<ref>\'\'Mutant X\'\' #31</ref><ref>\'\'Mutant X\'\' #32</ref>\n\n===New Son (Sun)===\nAppearing in the 1999 \'\'Gambit\'\' solo run, Gambit is called New Son (Sun) (X-Cutioner II) in Earth-9923 reality. In his own reality, the New Sun\'s kinetic charging powers had flared out of control, burning the world and killing everyone. As a result, the New Sun hunted down and killed versions of himself in other realities to ensure that they would not repeat his mistakes. New Sun is not limited to inorganic matter and can convert matter into energy at a sub-molecular level so it vaporizes or explodes. He also has the ability to time travel, can propel himself by a wave-like aura and can transplant matter through time and space, as well as being able to biokinetically augment all his physical abilities to superhuman levels.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 3 #7</ref>\n\nIn this reality, New Sun was never adopted by the Thieves Guild, so his real name is not "Remy LeBeau". New Sun was raised with his full power and intended to become the fulfillment of an ancient Guild prophecy to create Heaven on Earth. However, things went wrong when he charged up his power in a special ritual—a chain reaction was started that caused everyone on Earth beside himself to burn up. Failing to remake time, the New Sun traveled to other universes, hoping to prevent the same thing from happening there. However, he found many worlds in ruins, often because of that world\'s version of Gambit. Coming to the main Marvel Universe (616), he first attempted to create a new world where everyone would eventually be transported to, using the main reality\'s Gambit to help (without revealing to him who he truly was). When he learned that his plan wasn\'t possible, he tried to kill Gambit, transporting both of them to his destroyed homeworld before Gambit became a threat to the main universe\'s Earth world as well.\n\nDuring their final conflict, Gambit finally blasted the New Sun, burning out his recently increased powers, just as the New Sun died. Due to New Sun\'s immense power, it is speculated that New Sun was an [[omega-level mutant]] in his home dimension, and likely mutant alpha on Earth-9923; this, however, cannot be confirmed.<ref>\'\'Gambit\'\' vol. 3 #23</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn this universe, Remy LeBeau is a Cajun thief, similar to the normal mainstream version. A flashback shows that Remy was beaten maliciously by his father.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men #13">\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #13</ref><ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #14</ref>\n\nHe was subsequently brought up by a thief who taught him the arts of stealing. His connection to [[Mister Sinister#Ultimate Marvel|Sinister]] has been hinted, but yet to be made clear, though it is noticeable that in flashbacks his father has red eyes like Mr. Sinister. When he confronted Hammerhead, the latter mentioned Sinister while bantering with Gambit. Later as an adult, Remy lived on the streets of New York, performing card tricks with his "magic", and he continued to steal. It also shows he has trouble controlling his powers wherein Ultimate X-Men #14, where he states to the mobsters he just defeated that he is a mutant but struggles with controlling his powers. He also does not have his bo staff at this time.\n\nAt one point, [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]] offered Gambit the chance to join the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]], but he refused. While trying to save a young girl\'s life, Gambit also faced [[Hammerhead (comics)#Ultimate Hammerhead|Hammerhead]] and defeated him by making the mobster\'s [[adamantium]] skull explode.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men #13" />\n\nAt some point Gambit met scouts in New Orleans who represented Andreas and Andrea Von Strucker, the [[Fenris (comics)#Ultimate Fenris|Fenris Twins]]. The twins were presidents of Fenris International and secretly mutants. Their goal was to obtain mutant supremacy through economic empowerment. To accomplish this, they needed to find out the secrets of their business rivals. The twins made Gambit an offer that he could not refuse to participate in espionage activities. In addition to paying him, they cleaned up his accent and helped him control his powers.\n\nGambit ran into the X-Men again at the [[Coney Island]] Fair where he was sent by the Fenris Twins to recruit Rogue. To accomplish this Gambit had to get her alone and away from the X-Men team. He accomplished this by defeating the entire team by playing to their desire to avoid any bystander injuries.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men #50">\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #50</ref>\n\nHe collapsed a giant Ferris wheel (i.e., the Wonder Wheel) taking much of the team out of the equation (knowing that they would go to rescue the people on the ride) and defeated Wolverine by threatening to explode Wolverine\'s skeleton, which would destroy a large part of the near area. He then proceeded to explode his bo staff in Wolverine\'s mouth, thus giving him enough time to take Rogue. The Fenris Twins felt Rogue would be an ideal employee since her powers (which include viewing others’ memories) would be useful for learning others\' secrets. However, because of the unethical aspect of the job, Rogue refused. In response to seeing the fury of the twins, Gambit assisted Rogue in subduing the twins and escaping. As Rogue and Gambit escape, an enraged Wolverine finally tracks them down, beating Gambit badly with only his fists, preventing Gambit from making contact with his skeleton. Rogue stops Wolverine from killing Gambit and called him the true animal in this situation. Afterward, Gambit asked Rogue to come with him, commenting on how she and he were both alike. Rogue agreed and left the X-Men with him.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men #50" /><ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #53</ref>\n\nIn a battle with [[Juggernaut (comics)#Ultimate Juggernaut|Juggernaut]], Gambit appeared to suffer fatal injuries.

Sinister wished to destroy his master, Apocalypse, and to do so he needed a body that had not been subject to Apocalypse\'s altering. He then engineered mutant powers for the clone, using the DNA of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]. This technically makes him the [[third Summers brother]]; in that alternative reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/07/23/comic-book-legends-revealed-217/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #217|editor=[[Comic Book Resources]]|author=Brian Cronin|date=July 23, 2009|access-date=May 3, 2011}}</ref> However, Apocalypse learned of Sinister\'s plan and had the child stolen and left it in the care of the Thieves Guild.\n\nIt was originally believed that Gambit died in the series \'\'The End\'\' disguised as Sinister and trying to defeat the [[Shi\'ar]].
