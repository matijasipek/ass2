Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe original model was designed by Hydra and the Silver Dreadnought was built by the Maggia. Its robotic materials, design and construction from a titanium steel alloy afford the Dreadnought superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes. It has limited artificial intelligence, and no capacity for self-motivated activity. It\'s programmed for hand-to-hand combat in the style of an American boxer and for combat uses of its built-in weapons sub-systems.\n\nBoth major models\' gauntlets have [[flamethrower]] nozzles, capable of firing a hydrazine-liquid oxygen mix. Its knuckles are studded with spikes which can be shot like rifle bullets. From the modules mounted like ears, the Dreadnought generates a powerful electrical charge which conducts throughout its body\'s frame and through conducting material. The Dreadnought has no capability for projecting this electricity, but is capable of electrifying by touch. The Dreadnought\'s optical imaging sensor eyes are gamma ray particle beam projectors which can irradiate a target. The Dreadnought’s mouth is connected to a tank of refrigerated Freon gas which allows the Dreadnought a single-use attack of freezing breath.\n\nThe Dreadnought 2000 designed by A.I.M. has gauntlet projectors firing high pressure jets of either water, liquid oxygen, acid, oil, powerful adhesive, anesthetic gas, and/or napalm, and/or beams capable of liquefying steel or solidifying gases in the air. It also has the eight gunpowder-launched knuckle spikes, body-wide electrical field, gamma ray particle beam projectors in its optical imaging sensors, and refrigerated Freon gas dispenser in the "mouth" cavity of the previous models.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Dreadnoughts appear in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\'.{{cn|date=March 2017}} These versions are robotic drones built by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]].\n* Several versions of the Dreadnoughts appear in \'\'[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]\'\'. In the episode "The Final Showdown", the [[Red Skull|Iron Skull]] used an army via the [[Cosmic Cube]]. In the episode "Crack in the System", [[Hammer Industries]] builds a series of modern Dreadnoughts, including an experimental battle armor for [[Justin Hammer]], before [[Ultron]] uses them to attack the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. In the episode "Secret Avengers", Hydra uses old-fashioned Dreadnoughts as security before they are destroyed by the [[Secret Avengers|eponymous group]]. In the episode "Why I Hate Halloween", [[Madame Masque|Whitney Frost]] uses her own personal Dreadnoughts as security before they are destroyed by [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].\n\n===Video games===\n* The Dreadnoughts appear in \'\'[[Spider-Man: Web of Fire]]\'\'.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n* The Dreadnoughts appear in the \'\'[[Iron Man (video game)|Iron Man]]\'\' film tie-in game.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n* The Dreadnoughts appear in \'\'[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]\'\'.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/d/dreadnought.htm Dreadnought at MarvelDirectory.com]\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Steranko]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'}]}}}}
