However, Apocalypse and his forces attack the Askani\'s hiding place and steal the cloned infant. Apocalypse takes the child as his own, raising him himself and naming him "Stryfe", intending to use him as his next host body.

[[Madelyne Pryor]] appears to join forces with Stryfe, but secretly steals the psionic energy from Stryfe and gives it back to Nate. Nate, Madelyne, and Cable join forces to defeat Stryfe.<ref>\'\'X-Man\'\' #47</ref>\n\nStryfe reappears, controlling the activation sequence for the Prime Sentinels. He uses them to hunt down Lady Deathstrike, who holds the complete codes for all the Sentinels in her cybernetic systems. Deathstrike is forced to turn to the X-Men, and together they defeat Stryfe, who teleports away.<ref>\'\'X-Men Annual 2000\'\', writer Chris Claremont, artist Scot Eaton</ref>\n\nLater, Stryfe experiences a personal existential crisis and becomes depressed at the futility of his efforts over the years after the X-Men finally manage to cure the Legacy Virus, which Stryfe considered to be his life\'s work and the one permanent victory he had against Cable, his parents Scott and Jean, and the rest of the X-Men. He hunts down [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] who is possessed by the entity La Bete Noir, whose power rivals the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] and threatens to consume Bishop\'s body and unleash its evil upon the universe.<ref>\'\'Gambit & Bishop: Sons of the Atom\'\' #1</ref> However, Stryfe ultimately regrets the path he took and the choices he has made in his life (stemming from his perpetual identity crisis as a clone), frees Bishop from the entity and sacrifices himself to save the Earth by absorbing the Bete Noir into himself, shattering his body from the power overload. Gambit, however, is suspicious that Cable may have telepathically forced Stryfe to sacrifice himself.<ref>\'\'Gambit & Bishop - Sons of Atom\'\' #6</ref>\n\n===Messiah War===\nDuring \'\'[[Messiah War]]\'\', instead of dying, Stryfe was able to transport himself into the future where he is discovered by Bishop, who has been traveling through time in an attempt to kill Hope Summers.<ref>\'\'Cable #13\'\' (April 2009)</ref> This was confirmed by the writer Christopher Yost to be the same Stryfe that had previously plagued the X-Men, mentioning in particular his survival of his fight against Nate Grey and Cable.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22472 CCC09: X-Men Panel] August 9, 2009</ref> Bishop propositioned a chance to kill Apocalypse, if Stryfe aided him in killing Cable, who Stryfe said he no longer cared about. After Bishop initiated a global catastrophe that wiped out most of the people on Earth, Stryfe was able to step in and fill the leadership void. Together, Stryfe and Bishop traveled to 2963 A.D., where their combined efforts attacked Apocalypse while he slept in his rejuvenation chamber, and defeated him, assuming they killed him. Stryfe stole his Celestial Ship and technology and used it to raise an army that gave him total control over the people, save for a small rebellion. Stryfe tyrannically ruled over his subjects, the Stryfetroopers, with Bishop as his right-hand-man for nearly a decade. Stryfe placed Ship in Westchester County, New York and renamed the city, New Celestial City. Shortly after building his empire, Stryfe employed Deadpool as security and imprisoned Kiden Nixon, who was used to create a chronal net, preventing anyone from jumping out of the timeline. However, when Stryfe was reminded by Wolverine that he already "died a hero" to just become a villain again, Stryfe claims to not know what he is talking about. Cable, Deadpool, a time-displaced X-Force and Apocalypse join forces to defeat Stryfe and Bishop. Cable and Hope travel further into the future, X-Force return to the present, and Apocalypse drags Stryfe away, intending to use him as a new host body for his essence.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #16</ref>\n\n===Vendetta===\nStryfe is able to prevent Apocalypse from using his body as a new host and travels back in time to the present in the \'\'[[Cable and X-Force]]\'\' and \'\'[[Uncanny X-Force]]\'\' crossover, "Vendetta". Upon discovering that Bishop has returned to the present, Hope tries to kill him in an act of vengeance. Stryfe appears and kidnaps them both and brings them to an old, abandoned Mutant Liberation Force base.  There, he attempts to manipulate Hope into killing Bishop who has come to realize the error of his ways. Stryfe explains to Bishop how he wants him to suffer after he betrayed him during Messiah War and claims that he was imprisoned and tortured by Apocalypse for years until he planned a successful escape and killed him. Stryfe tries to corrupt Hope by making her give in to her feelings of hatred towards Bishop, convincing her to take revenge and murder Bishop although he is shackled and refuses to fight back out of remorse. Cable and both teams of X-Force soon intervene and combat Stryfe. Hope sees that Stryfe is trying to undo the lessons which Cable taught her and refuses to kill Bishop but she does severely injure him. Stryfe is defeated by Cable and both X-Force teams, but before escaping he telepathically forces Hope to mimic his vast and nearly uncontrollable psionic power in the hope that she will destroy her friends. Bishop helps her to disperse the massive energy and they come to an uneasy truce.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' Vol. 2 #16-17, \'\'Cable & X-Force\'\' #18-19</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nStryfe is a clone of the mutant Cable and, as a result, possesses Cable\'s natural vast psionic abilities of telepathy and telekinesis. However, these abilities are far more powerful than the ones Cable has generally displayed in the main continuity, sufficient to block the use of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]]\'s superhuman powers. This is because Stryfe was never infected with Apocalypse\'s techno-organic virus like Cable was. Therefore, he does not have to constantly expend his abilities to keep the virus from consuming his body, which apparently was a huge drain on Cable\'s capabilities. Stryfe can use his psionic abilities in a variety of ways such as moving large objects with his mind, reading minds, mind control, telepathically negating and activating the use of other\'s powers, telepathic camouflage, telekinetic flight, telekinetic force fields, mind transference and telekinetic blasts. Stryfe also has far more control over his massive psionic abilities than Cable or Nate Grey, apparently from having a whole lifetime of experience of learning how to use his powers which his alternate counterparts never had. Stryfe also possessed other abilities through genetic manipulation similar to those that Cable achieved through cybernetic augmentation, including superhuman strength and durability.\n\nStryfe wears battle armor of unknown composition that is highly impervious to damage. He has been known to wield a blade capable of harming Apocalypse. He has used various advanced weaponry and technology from the 39th century of his alternate future, including his time-vortex field generator.\n\nStryfe has received extensive training in military combat techniques and the martial arts, and is a master marksman with firearms. He is a cunning terrorist strategist.\n\n==Reception==\n* In 2017, \'\'[[WhatCulture]]\'\' ranked Stryfe 3rd in their "10 Most Evil X-Men Villains" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Young |first=Andrew |date=2017-02-24 |title=10 Most Evil X-Men Villains |url=https://whatculture.com/comics/10-most-evil-x-men-villains?page=8 |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=WhatCulture.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn \'\'[[Ultimate X-Men]]\'\', [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] Stryfe is also the leader of the Mutant Liberation Front. He appears to be a mutant supremacist convinced that [[Professor X]] was killed by the United States government and that mutants should fight against the government.{{Issue|date=March 2012}} His mutant power manifests as the ability to cause "strife" within people\'s minds, causing them to voice whatever is bothering them. However, when [[Betsy Braddock#Ultimate Marvel|Psylocke]] scans his mind she senses that he has no real conviction in what he says, suggesting that much of his mutant supremacist attitude is an act, meaning his real motives are unknown.{{Issue|date=March 2012}} At his side is the ultimate version of [[Zero (android)|Zero]], a young mutant teleporter. It is revealed that Stryfe is actually a con man, working with [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]] to promote mutant unrest so they can sell [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] to the government.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #84</ref>\n\nIn \'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\', when [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] returns from the future with Xavier they both don armor; Xavier\'s resembling [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] and Cable\'s resembling the mainstream Stryfe.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #92</ref>\n\n===Deadpool Pulp===\nIn the \'\'[[Deadpool Pulp]]\'\' timeline, a \'\'\'General Stryfe\'\'\' is introduced. Stryfe is a younger, corrupt General, who alongside [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[J. Edgar Hoover]] hire Wade Wilson (who in this timeline is a former CIA man, turned merc) to get back a stolen [[nuclear briefcase]].<ref>\'\'Deadpool Pulp\'\' #1</ref> Stryfe is later killed by Deadpool.<ref>\'\'Deadpool Pulp\'\' #3</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Stryfe appeared briefly in \'\'[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]\'\'. In the episode "Beyond Good and Evil" (Part 4), he was one of Apocalypse\'s captured [[psychics]].<ref>{{Cite episode | title=Beyond Good and Evil, Part 4: End and Beginning | series=X-Men: The Animated Series | series-link=X-Men: The Animated Series | season=4 | number=15 | airdate=November 25, 1995}} Redistributed in \'\'X-Men: Volume 4\'\' (Marvel DVD Collection).</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Stryfe was the final boss in the [[Sega Game Gear]] game \'\'[[X-Men 2: Game Master\'s Legacy]]\'\'.\n* Stryfe appears as a boss in \'\'[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]\'\', voiced by [[Daniel Riordan]]. He is guarding the prison in Apocaplyse\'s tower in which [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and [[Iron Man]] are being held captive. To help defeat Stryfe, the players will need to use a Psychic Demon Spawn Control to create a Psychic Demon to help them fight Stryfe. He has special dialogue with [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]].\n\n===Other appearances===\n* An [[action figure]] of Stryfe was produced by [[Toy Biz]] in 1992 as part of the first X-Force line. He was packaged with a snap-on cape, adamantium mace accessory and a flip-up helmet to reveal his identity.\n* A second action figure of Stryfe was produced by [[Hasbro]] in 2014 as part of their [[Marvel Legends]] line. He is packaged with a golden sword and the head of his set\'s Build-A-Figure (BAF) Jubilee.\n* Stryfe has been made in two playing pieces in the Heroclix game system.
