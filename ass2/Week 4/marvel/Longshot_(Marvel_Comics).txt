After most of Marvel\'s artists had declined to take on the project, it was offered to aspiring artist [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]], whose samples had been given to editor [[Carl Potts]] and Nocenti, his assistant editor, by editor [[Al Milgrom]].<ref name="CBA#17"/>\n\nExplaining the concept of the character, which Nocenti borrowed from [[existentialist]] writers, she states, "Longshot is the idea of stripping someone of everything that they are. I never read comics, so the idea of a hero to me was different. I couldn\'t think of it in terms of a \'super hero\' hero. I thought of it more as a conceptual hero. Not having a comic book background, I tend to come up with the metaphysics before I come up with the characters. I knew that I wanted to deal with the metaphysics of [[luck]]. It was a concept that interested me...what luck is, what probability is, how you could shift probabilities towards yourself. What are the repercussions of that? So, I did a character centered around that idea." Nocenti describes Longshot\'s state at the beginning of the miniseries by referring to him as "a clean slate. He has no memories, no past, no name, no nothing...In a sense, what I was trying to do was strip someone down to where he had none of the crutches that we normally have. Memory, in a way, is a crutch, or your name, or what you believe you are. So, Longshot\'s odyssey begins with some very basic questions: Who is he? Why is he here? Ultimately, he goes on a quest for his past and finds it in search of him."<ref name=MarvelAge>Ringgenberg, Steve (August 1985). \'\'[[Marvel Age]]\'\' #29. p. 13-15.</ref>\n\nA design for the character of Longshot was put forward by [[Carl Potts]], who outfitted the character in a jumpsuit that Adams thought to be reminiscent of the [[Starfleet]] uniforms from \'\'[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]\'\'.<ref name="CBA#17">Cooke, Jon B.

The Adventures of Dr. McNinja.</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Origins===\nLongshot is an artificially created humanoid life-form, with the ability to defy probability.  He is from an alternate  dimension known as "Mojoworld" or the "Mojoverse".  He is one of many slaves created by genetic engineers in the employ of Mojoworld\'s masters, the grossly obese, virtually immobile Spineless Ones, who are ruled by the media-obsessed delusional maniac named [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]].  The head geneticist, Arize, gave Longshot and his other creations (such as the ram-headed Quark) free will and a conscience, hoping that one day they would rise up against their masters.\n\nLongshot and many of his fellow slaves rebel against the slave-masters. They undergo a mystical ritual that gives them the power to create good luck for themselves. Despite this power, their masters win the war due to their superior weaponry and the limits of the slaves\' luck. Longshot is rendered amnesiac by the Spineless Ones, but he manages to flee from Mojoworld to Earth. A number of Mojo\'s servants, led by the hound-like Gog and Magog, pursue him, but get stuck between Longshot\'s world and Earth. Unable to remember his real name, Longshot becomes an adventurer and takes the name "Longshot" after several humans call him that due to his incredible good luck. While recovering, Longshot befriends the human stunt-woman named [[Rita Wayword|Ricochet Rita]] and works as a movie stuntman himself. He also adopts the docile Magog, who he renames "Pup". Finally, Mojo and his assistant, the six-armed sword-wielding assassin named [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], follow Longshot to Earth. Longshot battles Spiral, and defeats Mojo with the aid of Ricochet Rita, Quark, and [[Doctor Strange]], who then send Mojo and his minions back to the Mojoverse. Longshot, Quark and Rita return to the Mojoverse to free the other slaves.<ref name=Longshot22>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Nocenti, Ann]]|penciller=[[Arthur Adams (comics)|Adams, Arthur]]|inker=[[Portacio, Whilce]]|title=Longshot|issue=1–6|date=September 1985–February 1986|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\n===Member of the X-Men===\nAfter an unsuccessful rebellion, a once-again amnesiac Longshot is sent back to Earth by Mojo, where he joins the [[X-Men]].<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), Adams, Arthur (p). \'\'Uncanny X-Men Annual\'\' #10.

He\'s \'\'lucky\'\', he\'s miraculous in a way...he was born with this talent to have access to being lucky, and the problem is that he finds out that there\'s a flip side to luck. There are repercussions. If you pull probabilities towards yourself, you\'re probably taking them away from other people, so it\'s actually something that he shouldn\'t even be doing."<ref name=MarvelAge/> He was genetically engineered and augmented by magical means to have certain superhuman abilities. The mystical augmentation gave him the ability to affect probability fields through [[psionics|psionic]] means to give himself "good luck" in his activities. This allows incredibly unlikely events to happen in Longshot\'s favor. This power operates even when Longshot does not consciously will it, and is tied into the positive aspects of his personality: should he attempt to use his powers for a selfish or evil act, or should lose hope, his powers will fail to function or even backfire, giving him bad luck.<ref name=Longshot2/> Echoing Nocenti\'s words on the adverse side effects of his powers, Longshot\'s luck is fickle, and can backfire if he overuses it, creating an equal and opposite "bad luck" effect elsewhere, that can affect others or even Longshot himself.<ref name=Longshot5>{{Cite comic|writer=Nocenti, Ann|penciller=Adams, Arthur|inker=Portacio, Whilce|story=Deadly Lies|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=5|date=January 1986|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref><ref name=Longshot6>{{Cite comic|writer=Nocenti, Ann|penciller=Adams, Arthur|inker=Portacio, Whilce|story=A Snake Coils|title=Longshot|volume=1|issue=6|date=February 1986|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Longshot\'s left eye glows brightly when he uses his superhuman powers.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nLongshot can read "psychic imprints" that people leave on objects that they have handled, and thereby learn the thoughts that an individual had while handling the object, a phenomenon known as [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]].<ref name=Longshot1/> He can also read a person\'s future in this manner.<ref name=Longshot5/> He can also telepathically "read" the recent memories of a person by making physical contact with him or her.<ref name=Longshot3/> Nocenti elaborates on the psychometry thus: "If you picked up a hammer and used it to bang nails every day and Longshot went to read it, he may not read much of it, but if it was used to kill somebody, that would leave a bigger psychic imprint, even if somebody held an object and cried over it, he would feel that too.
