Upon returning to England with the Earth-616 contestants, Outlaw had also wished for those he had killed to be returned to life.

She is a descendant of Lance Temple, who was also known as the Wild West gunman [[The Outlaw Kid]].<ref>\'\'The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z\'\' vol. 9</ref><ref>\'\'Deadpool Rank and Foul\'\'</ref>\n\nWhen she grew up, she became a [[mercenary]], covering her hair with a long, blonde wig and even had breast augmentation surgery.<ref>\'\'[[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]\'\' #2 (October 2002)</ref> She encountered [[Deadpool]] several times and flirted with him,{{issue|date=January 2013}} but the two never really got a chance to hit it off. Outlaw was called in as a shooting instructor for [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Alex Hayden]] aka Agent X. They were both hired shortly afterwards to steal the Punisher\'s Colt .45 handguns and despite being competitors, they started a romantic relationship. They failed to steal the Punisher\'s guns and were locked up in a phone booth minus their weapons and clothes by Castle. The Punisher then killed the people who had sent them.{{issue|date=January 2013}} After that Outlaw started to work with Agent X.{{issue|date=January 2013}} When Alex announced his plans to set up a special agency for mercenaries, known as Agency X, she had to disappoint him though; her father had taken ill and she went back to Texas to be with him.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nShe returned after her father died and discovered that in her absence Alex had had an affair with his secretary [[Sandi Brandenberg]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} Her rage vanished when she saw that Alex was being attacked by the [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]. Black Swan called Outlaw "Crazy Inez" and in a fit of rage, Outlaw punched straight through his torso.

Outside the X-Men get involved with a fight against Bishop and the O*N*E and Domino wants to help them. Lorelei Travis notices that Cyclops is being controlled by Johnny Dee and recounts the story of the first few days at the 198 encampment. Outlaw is then used by Johnny Dee along with other mutants to attack Domino and Shatterstar. After holding Domino at gunpoint, Toad snaps her out of it. They are all freed from the bunker by combined X-Men, Avengers and military forces. Outlaw takes a leadership role throughout the crisis.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Civil War\'\' #1–4 (2006)</ref>\n\nOutlaw was later kidnapped, bound and gagged along with [[Sandi Brandenberg]] by [[T-Ray (comics)|T-Ray]], one of Deadpool\'s nemeses.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Deadpool swiftly rescued them, seemingly killing T-Ray by skewering his head with his sword.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The two were reunited with a now-obese Agent X, after being experimented on by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]],{{issue|date=January 2013}} and ended up under Deadpool\'s employ after being tentatively appointed head of Agency X by Hayden.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Outlaw and Sandi then joined [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]] to help bring Deadpool and Bob: Agent of HYDRA back to the present day, after Weasel accidentally transported the two to World War II.{{issue|date=January 2013}} After they were restored, the two stayed with the [[Fantastic Four]], allegedly to play cards.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nAfter being critically wounded from a fight with the Punisher, Deadpool comes to Outlaw for assistance. She reveals that she and Agent X are no longer in a relationship.<ref>\'\'Deadpool: Suicide Kings\'\' #2</ref> Deadpool later returns and remodels her house after it is destroyed during a fight with the Punisher.

During Second Coming, after the dome is set and the Nimrods arrive, Cyclops gathers mutants, including Inez, and delivers a speech saying that it\'s everyone\'s time to fight, today they are all combatants, today they are all X-Men.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' (vol. 4) #14</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Nigel Higgins version of Outlaw has exceptional skills with firearms.\n\nThe Inez Temple version of Outlaw has some degree of superhuman strength, the exact limits of which aren\'t known. However, she can punch through brick walls with ease. The tissues of her body are somewhat more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, she is far from invulnerable and can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials or with sufficient force, much like an ordinary human. Nonetheless she can withstand high caliber bullets without them penetrating, though she isn\'t totally impervious to them. In at least one instance after being shot with .45 caliber bullet from a moderate distance, Inez sustained no more injury other than some bruises. If injured, Outlaw is capable of healing herself somewhat faster from minor injuries than an ordinary human. Apart from her mutant powers, Outlaw has exceptional skills with firearms and with a lasso.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n===Deadpool Pulp===\nIn re-imagining of Deadpool set during the McCarthy era, the Inez Temple version of Outlaw is a fugitive from the United States after she is accused of stealing atomic bomb equipment.<ref>\'\'Deadpool Pulp\'\' #1–4 (November 2010–February 2011)</ref>\n\n===Deadpool MAX===\nIn this version, Outlaw is an insane asylum patient with dissociative multiple personality disorder with whom Deadpool has a brief relationship. She first poses as a psychiatrist to lure Deadpool there in order to extract his organs for illegal donations at the behest of a hospital doctor, but develops feelings for him and helps him escape.<ref>\'\'Deadpool MAX\'\' #2</ref> Later on, she reappears as [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], asking Deadpool to elope with her as she reveals to be pregnant with his baby;<ref>\'\'Deadpool MAX\'\' #6</ref> however, the pregnancy is soon revealed to be fake and, through the trust of a Deadpool in denial, she assumes an appearance similar to [[Black Widow (comics)|Black Widow]] under the name "Honey Moon", in which Deadpool has her committed to the asylum again.<ref>\'\'Deadpool MAX\'\' #7</ref> She is seen later still as a Mrs. Claus-styled dominatrix called "Santa Clawz", with delusions of wanting to destroy Christmas by giving guns to children and forcing other inmates to make the weapons; only all they can do is draw guns on papers, and Deadpool and Bob quickly talk her down again.<ref>\'\'Deadpool MAX X-Mas Special\'\'</ref> Her "Outlaw" persona only appears in flashbacks told by [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]], another inmate whom she trained and asked to go after Bob and Deadpool for the US$10 million bounty on their heads.<ref>\'\'Deadpool MAX II\'\' #4</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n* The Inez Temple version of Outlaw appears as a member of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] team that confronts the [[Punisher]] in the final cutscene of the 2009 [[PlayStation Network]] game \'\'[[The Punisher: No Mercy]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite video game|title = \'\'[[The Punisher: No Mercy]]\'\'|developer = [[Zen Studios]]|publisher = [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|date = 2 July 2009|platform = [[PlayStation 3]]|version = 1.0|scene = |level = |quote = }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\n* While not appearing in person, a life-sized cutout of the Inez Temple version of Outlaw is seen in \'\'[[Deadpool 2]]\'\', during the scene where Deadpool and Weasel interview the future members of [[X-Force]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051121081608/http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=1616 Uncannyxmen.net character bio on Outlaw]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206110926/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/outlawax.htm a more detailed look at Outlaw]\n\n{{Punisher}}\n{{Deadpool}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Outlaw (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Andy Lanning]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Abnett]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gail Simone]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2002]]\n[[Category:Fictional Black British people]]\n[[Category:Fictional British people]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Fictional gunfighters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional people from London]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]'}]}}}}
