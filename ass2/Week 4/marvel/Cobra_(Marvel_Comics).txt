A combination of a bite from a radioactive cobra and the experimental anti-venom granted him superpowers, which led to him becoming the supervillain briefly known as the Human Cobra and then as the Cobra.

During a takeover attempt by the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], the Cobra actually opposed her rule and sided with [[Captain America]] to depose the Viper and foil her plans. The Cobra later took the name "the King Cobra" as he assumed leadership of the Serpent Society. When the Serpent Society became Serpent Solutions under the leadership of the [[Viper (Marvel Comics)#Jordan Stryke|Viper]] (Jordan Stryke, a different Viper) the King Cobra became a member of the group.\n\nHis nephew, Piet Voorhees, became the second Cobra and first appeared in \'\'[[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]]\'\' #1 (Jan. 2007) in a story written by [[Tamora Pierce]] and drawn by [[Timothy Liebe]]. Piet Voorhees was injected with the same chemicals that gave his uncle his powers and he became the second Cobra, working as a mercenary. On one mission he encountered the [[White Tiger (Angela Del Toro)|White Tiger]], who defeated him. The Cobra later joined the Serpent Squad, organized by [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] and would also work for [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] as a mercenary.\n\nMarvel has also used the moniker "Cobra" for two [[World War II]] Nazi villains and also a mercenary enemy of [[Moon Knight]].\n\nThe original Cobra has appeared outside of Marvel Comics, most notably in "The Mighty Thor" portion of \'\'[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\' as well as in episodes of \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\' and  \'\'[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]\'\'.\n\n==Publication history==\n\'\'\'Klaus Voorhees\'\'\' was briefly known as the \'\'\'Human Cobra\'\'\', then was known as the \'\'\'Cobra\'\'\' and is currently known as the \'\'\'King Cobra\'\'\'.

Klaus was an ex-convict and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] laboratory assistant to Professor Schecktor, a scientist working in [[India]] and looking for a cure for venomous snake bites. Unsatisfied with his lower position, and intent on stealing Schecktor\'s discoveries, Voorhees killed Schecktor by using a [[cobra]]. In order to make himself look less guilty, Cobra let the cobra bite him as well. He used an experimental anti-venom for snake venom to cure himself, but denied it to Schecktor. The cobra was radioactive due to experimentation and in a process similar to that which granted [[Spider-Man]] his powers, Voorhees gained superhuman abilities similar to a cobra\'s. Thor\'s mortal form Don Blake had encountered Schecktor. As Thor, he met the dying man and learned what had happened and that Cobra was traveling to America. Cobra attempted to manufacture a cobra-serum to transform others into similarly-powered slaves, but was thwarted by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Although Cobra escaped using Jane Foster as a hostage.<ref>\'\'Journey into Mystery\'\' #98.

Thor followed them to a house where traps had been set up for him. Hyde was defeated and then Thor manipulated the power supply of the house. Using his hammer, he sent a charge through the house that electrocuted Cobra. The weakened Cobra was forced out of a pipe next to Thor. He was easily defeated by Thor and left bound, before being arrested with Hyde.<ref>\'\'Journey into Mystery\'\' #110–111.

Klaus injected Piet with the same mutagenic serum that first gave him his own superhuman abilities. Using these new powers for selfish means, Piet became a high-level international mercenary. He has performed operations in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Chechnya]].\n\nMore recently, Cobra has become involved with an international cartel known as Chaeyi. He has been working to get stolen passports and visas to [[illegal aliens]]. This operation has brought him into conflict with the newest [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|White Tiger]].\n\nIn a new costume, he has since turned up as a member of [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]]\'s new Serpent Squad in the employ of the [[Red Skull]]. He broke Crossbones out of jail<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 5 #28–29. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later attacked the White House, but he was stopped by [[Bucky Barnes|the new Captain America]].

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the prelude to "Hunted", Cobra was among the animal-themed characters that were captured by the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and the [[Eric O\'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] on [[Kraven the Hunter]]\'s behalf. He was grouped with the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]], the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]], the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]], and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] as the [[Savage Six]] by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]. In this appearance, the Cobra was identified by Arcade as the King Cobra.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 5 #16.

When Spider-Man fought the Savage Six, he made a comment that he never fought this version of Cobra before.<ref>\'\'Sinister War\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nKlaus Voorhees gained superhuman powers due to the combined mutagenic effects of the venom of a radioactive cobra and an experimental anti-venom. King Cobra is double-jointed, can dislocate and snap back into place his shoulders and hips at will, and has a phenomenal mastery of his musculature. Most notably, his amazing [[contortionist]] powers and slithery body let him break in, and escape from, buildings. He also has the ability to stick to walls or ceilings. Combined with his superstrength, agility, reflexes and reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance, they make him a formidable [[wrestler]]. King Cobra\'s bones are flexible and nearly impossible to break. King Cobra has moderate knowledge of street-fighting techniques. King Cobra wears a bodysuit made of reinforced synthetic stretch material; the torso section, helmet, and tail are made of a bendable plastoid and the entire costume is coated with silicon and graphite dust compound to make it slippery. King Cobra is also armed with special gadgets that complete his cobra likeness: he is equipped with a "cobra cord" (an unbreakable cable) to tie up his enemies (it is solid enough to resist even Thor\'s strength), can launch "cobra darts" ([[venom]]-filled projectiles) out of his wrists and release toxic "cobra gas". He wears spring-loaded wrist-shooters propelling "cobra-bite" projectiles containing a poison derived from cobra venom. He uses cartridge projectiles filled with various substances: acid, smoke, nerve gas, plastic explosives, etc. He wears micro-suction cups on his fingertips and toes, permitting him to cling to walls and ceilings. In the miniseries \'\'[[Toxin (comics)|Toxin: The Devil You Know]]\'\', King Cobra himself says:\n\n{{quote|"My bones are almost impossible to break. My tissue doesn\'t tear. I don\'t get [[hangover]]s, either."}}\n\nPiet Voorhees possesses certain unusual physical powers derived from his mutagenically altered physiology which, among other things, help him simulate the movement of a snake by using his great degree of independent control over every muscle in his body, enabling him to slither across the ground (at up to 50 miles per hour) without using his arms and legs, simply by muscle contraction. All of the bones in his body, including his skull, are malleable and his muscle tissue is exceedingly resilient, making his body very flexible and pliant. It is nearly impossible for him to break a bone or tear a muscle.<ref>F.B.I. Agent Coville revealed in \'\'White Tiger\'\' #1 that Piet has all of the same superpowers that his uncle possesses.</ref> Cobra\'s flexibility enables him to slither into and out of very tight and small places. Through compressing his body, Cobra can fit into any hole or slot down to four inches (102&nbsp;mm) in diameter. By using his flexibility to wrap himself about a victim\'s body and then exerting his full strength, Cobra traps that victim within his "cobra grip". Unlike his uncle however, Piet also possesses enhanced olfactory senses, which enables him to track his targets by way of their scent. He can also produce a toxic substance from his body which he calls his "cobra venom". He projects his venom at selected targets by spitting at them.\n\n==Other characters named the Cobra==\n===Albri Leiricgrie===\nAlbri Leiricgrie is a costumed villain who worked for the Nazis during [[World War II]] and was an enemy of the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] and [[Toro (comics)|Toro]].<ref>\'\'Captain America Comics\'\' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Cobra (Nazi spy)===\nThere was also a Cobra who worked as a spy for the Nazis during World War II and was an enemy of [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]].<ref>\'\'Human Torch Comics\'\' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===James Lardner===\nA few months after his brother Amos Lardner disappeared, James Lardner joined the CIA where he met Marc Spector, a.k.a. the [[Moon Knight]]. When Marc asked about James\' brother Amos, James never talked about him. Three years later, James sought vengeance upon those who were involved with Operation: Cobra. Blaming Marc Spector, he launched a grenade at Marc\'s mansion, yet Marc survived. James later launched a grenade at Ravencrag Asylum. Meanwhile, Marc received Amos Lardner\'s corpse and went to Ravencrag to see if there was a connection. Marc Spector was present when James Lardner attacked. Marc changed into the [[Moon Knight]] and went after James Lardner, who used a gas grenade to escape. When in Paris, James went after Charles le Blanc, who was the head of Operation: Cobra. Marc Spector also investigated Charles le Blanc and encountered James Lardner. Marc Spector pursued James Lardner in a high-speed chase, where they were knocked unconscious upon colliding. The agents that worked for Operation: Cobra managed to capture James and Marc, only for Marc to escape. James, however, became the successful test subject that was dubbed Cobra. The next night when the Moon Knight went to investigate Charles le Blanc, Operation: Cobra sent Cobra to dispose of the Moon Knight. The Moon Knight had a hard time fighting off Cobra, until he spotted Charles le Blanc using his remote control and shot a dart at it. The dart shorted out the remote control, causing Cobra to go berserk. Charles le Blanc escaped to his car and started to drive off only for the Moon Knight to fire another dart at one of the tires, which caused the car to swerve and catch on fire upon colliding with a tree. When Cobra wanted to seek vengeance and started to lift the front part of Charles le Blanc\'s car into the air, it exploded and killed both Cobra and Charles le Blanc.<ref>\'\'Marvel Preview\'\' #21.
