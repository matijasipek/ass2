The character first appeared in the comic \'\'[[She-Hulk]]\'\'. She is Holden Holliway\'s granddaughter and in the custody of She-Hulk (and if She-Hulk becomes Jennifer Walters, then [[Awesome Android (comics)|Awesome Andy]]).\n\nShe is incredibly powerful because of a gauntlet she wears that cannot be removed. She has a short temper and will often act without thinking (i.e., destroying her high school because they brought back school uniforms, or attacking the [[Champion of the Universe|Champion]] because he took a piece of fruit from her).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSasha first appeared in \'\'She-Hulk\'\' #5 attacking the [[New Warriors]] (who were trying to stop her from stealing [[compact disc|CD]]s) sending [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] flying into a building and grabbing Namorita. She was later subdued by [[Night Thrasher]] and was taken to the Big House prison for superhumans. The [[Mad Thinker]] told her to aid them in an escape. The miniature villains shrank down further and stowed away on She-Hulk\'s hand. When Yellowjacket used his re-enlarging gas on Southpaw, the other villains returned to small size.<ref>\'\'She-Hulk\'\' #5</ref> She aided [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]] in subduing the [[U-Foes]] after they threatened to kill Holliway.<ref>\'\'She-Hulk\'\' #6</ref> She was later taken with She-Hulk to Skardon to aid the [[Living Tribunal|Magistrati]] in dethroning Champion and unwittingly gave She-Hulk the answer to defeat the Champion.<ref>\'\'She-Hulk\'\' #7</ref>\n\n==Future Southpaw==\n===She-Hulk===\nIn a possible future detailed in \'\'[[She-Hulk]]\'\', Southpaw becomes a lawyer and an active superheroine (inspired by The [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] and complete with a partner/sidekick, Kid Glove) and eventually gets recruited from fifteen years in the future to act as She-Hulk\'s lawyer when the [[Time Variance Authority]] attempts to remove her from the timeline.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Bishop===\nIn [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]\'s future someone named Southpaw worked with Hancock in the Summers Rebellion.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Whether or not this is the same Southpaw is unknown; this future is portrayed as 70 years in the Marvel Universe\'s future.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSouthpaw can use the gauntlet to project energy hands that mimic what her hand inside the gauntlet is doing. These hands are powerful enough to restrain [[She-Hulk]] temporarily (although She-Hulk subsequently  played "[[This Little Piggy]]" with the energy hand\'s fingers; this forced Southpaw\'s fingers open and caused Southpaw great discomfort).{{Issue|date=January 2010}} The energy hand was certainly strong enough to twist [[Ironclad (comics)|Ironclad]]\'s arm.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} She uses the hands as her main attack method, mainly by grabbing an opponent. She can also perform feats of class 100 strength, but only with her left hand. Her gauntlet\'s size and shape appears to alter at random.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{She-Hulk}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2004]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Slott]]'}]}}}}
