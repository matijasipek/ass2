The character appeared posthumously in \'\'Alpha Flight: In the Beginning\'\' #-1 (July 1997).\n\nJerome Jaxon appeared as part of the "Omega Flight" entry in the \'\'[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]\'\' #9.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nJerome Jaxon was born in [[Red Deer, Alberta]], Canada. He was an executive vice president in charge of research and development at Am-Can Petroleum Company.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | year = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 7  | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> One of his subordinates at Am-Can, [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]], had developed a powered exoskeleton designed for excavation, which Jaxon sought to weaponize for military purposes. Hudson refused, and with the support of Jaxon\'s secretary [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather MacNeil]], Hudson destroyed the plans, stole and abandoned the prototype, and kept the cybernetic control helmet. At Heather\'s urging, Hudson sought protection from the Canadian government; with the assistance of the Prime Minister, Hudson was exonerated of any wrongdoing, and inspired by the emergence of American superheroes such as the [[Fantastic Four]], Hudson was given authority to create a Canadian superhero team under the direction of [[Department H]]. Hudson revamped his exosuit into a form-fitting battlesuit which he eventually donned as leader of Alpha Flight, under the codenames Weapon Alpha, Vindicator, and, finally, [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Guardian]].{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe failure to deliver a weapons system based on Hudson\'s designs proved devastating to Jaxon\'s career. After being dismissed from Am-Can, his wife took their two children and left him. Destitute, and with no prospects for the future, Jaxon attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself, only to be discovered by his landlady. Although Jaxon lived, the brain damage suffered from asphyxiation left him permanently unable to walk.<ref>\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' #12</ref>\n\nAfter learning about Alpha Flight, and realizing that Guardian had to be James Hudson, Jaxon sought out [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], the parent company of the now-dissolved Am-Can. Roxxon executives proved receptive to Jaxon\'s ideas, and granted him a position as executive vice president. Paired with [[Delphine Courtney]], a servitor robot disguised as a human woman, Jaxon set about plotting his revenge against Hudson by having Courtney recruit several superhuman castoffs from the discontinued Department H program: [[Diamond Lil (Marvel Comics)|Diamond Lil]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], [[Flashback (comics)|Flashback]], [[Smart Alec (comics)|Smart Alec]], and Roger Bochs, creator of the [[Box (comics)|Box robot]]. Diamond Lil, Smart Alec, and Wild Child had been part of [[Gamma Flight]], and Flashback and Box part of [[Beta Flight]]. While the others were willing to go along with Jaxon\'s revenge plan, Bochs had no ill will toward Hudson, and chose to infiltrate the group, which Jaxon dubbed [[Omega Flight]].{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nAs Alpha Flight had been disbanded, James Hudson had been looking for steady work, and Jaxon sent Courtney to offer him a job at Roxxon\'s [[New York City]] office. With support from his wife Heather, Hudson accepted, and they moved in. However, Courtney lured Heather into a trap, where Jaxon revealed to her his plan for revenge; due to Heather\'s role in Jaxon\'s downfall, she was to be killed, but only after Guardian had been destroyed.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nWhen Guardian learned of the nature of Heather\'s kidnapping, he flew into Jaxon\'s trap at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], and faced off against Omega Flight. Alpha Flight soon arrived on the scene, having been teleported to New York by [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]]. During the battle between the two Flights, Box removed Guardian from the main fight into another part of the building. It was there that Jaxon revealed that he had taken control of the Box robot from Roger Bochs, as he wanted to kill Guardian personally. Although he brutally beat Guardian, badly damaging his battlesuit, Hudson was able to use his own suit to overload the Box robot; the feedback to the control helmet killed Jaxon.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nAlthough relieved that Bochs had not betrayed him, Hudson had little time to celebrate his victory, as his suit was about to explode. Heather, who\'d gotten away from Courtney after discovering the robot\'s true nature, entered the room just as the suit was overloading, and as it exploded, Hudson appeared to be burned to ashes in front of Heather\'s eyes.{{issue|date=February 2014}} Jaxon had seemingly achieved a [[pyrrhic victory]], although it was later revealed that Guardian had managed to channel the overload into an extension of the gravity-cancelling ability of his suit that sent him on a trip through time and space;{{issue|date=February 2014}} Heather would go on to lead Alpha Flight as [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator)]],{{issue|date=February 2014}} and eventually be reunited with her husband.<ref>\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' #90</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100259/http://www.alphaflight.net/alphanex/index.php?title=Jaxon_Jerome \'\'\'AlphaFlight.Net\'\'\' Alphanex Entry on - Jerome Jaxon]\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/jaxonjerryaf.htm|Jerry Jaxon}}\n\n{{Flight Program}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jaxon, Jerry}}\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne (comics)]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1983]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Alberta]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'}]}}}}
