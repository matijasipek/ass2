This ended when his nephew, attempting to follow in his favorite uncle\'s footsteps, was caught and killed after accidentally hacking into the private computers of the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]. While personally investigating his nephew\'s murder, Lieberman met and started collaborating with the [[Punisher]]. Microchip\'s help proved invaluable to Castle: he served not just as a hacker and cyber-investigator, but provided him with invaluable services, such as managing and laundering his finances (i.e., the money Castle takes from the criminals he kills), establishing and maintaining Castle\'s safehouses, helping Castle train in more "specialized" skills for his war on crime, and obtaining hard-to-get ammunition and equipment. Less obsessed with Castle\'s personal war, Microchip also acts as a de facto counselor to Castle (e.g., encouraging Castle to take occasional vacations and breaks, to avoid burn-out or losing his mind).\n\nOver time, more of his past history is revealed. His father had been forced to create weapons against his will years before Micro was born; in the same issue he mentions his sister is a happy housewife in [[Ft. Lauderdale]].<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 2 #46 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref> Micro has an illegitimate son named Louis Frohike, who winds up getting killed while trying to assist the Punisher in a hostage exchange.<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 2 #9 (1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMicro is capable of fighting on his own such as when he took on an assassination ring threatening his godson\'s family.<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 2 Annual #1 (1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> He also takes on less violent crime, such as when he discovered his new neighbor was being scammed by a "charity". He takes down the scammers from within, not by violence but by stealing incriminating records and sending them to fans of yodeling music so they can be publicized while keeping his involvement secret.<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 2 Annual #3 (1990). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOutside of crime, some plots have revolved around Leiberman\'s weight. In one instance, he attempted to take a break and better control his health by enrolling in a rural camp for overweight people, which claimed to offer a revolutionary weight-loss drug to participants. However, he is once again drawn back into crime-fighting and seeking Castle\'s aid when he realizes the camp is a front for an [[amphetamines]] ring, and that the "weight-loss" drug was in fact intended to turn the camp\'s attendees into addicts.<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 2 Annual #4 (1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOne issue that dealt primarily with Micro was when Castle massacres a street gang running drugs, but a dealer named Jamal Jones survives. Micro warns Frank that Jones is hospitalized under heavy police protection and takes it upon himself to infiltrate the hospital through different disguises, first dressing as a telephone lineman and then a reporter under the pseudonym Linus Schultz (a likely reference to [[Charles M. Schulz]] and his famous character [[Linus van Pelt]]), so he could contact Jones with a message that the Punisher wants the name of his drug connection or he\'ll come back to finish the job. A slight insight to his wish to have a life outside of crime-fighting occurs when Micro thinks to himself about a brief meeting with a nurse and how even a casual encounter with a woman causes him to recognize that he spends "too much time with Frank and his \'war\'".\n\nMicro loses his left pinky finger when the Kingpin sends it to Castle after kidnapping his partner and threatening to use his knowledge of the Punisher\'s crimes to expose him. He is released from the Kingpin\'s custody when the Punisher agrees to kill one of the boss\'s rivals.<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 2 #53 (Oct. 1991). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Punisher\'s 1992 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] entitled \'\'[[The Punisher War Zone (1992 series)|The Punisher War Zone]]\'\', written by [[Chuck Dixon]] and penciled by [[John Romita, Jr.]], provided further development for Micro. The first issues describe his growing disillusionment with the Punisher\'s crusade, with Micro going so far as to see a [[psychiatrist]] and take up acting in an attempt to deal with his frustration. After Castle discovers this, the two have a disagreement and Micro goes into hiding, working as a barman.\n\nMicro develops a friendship with [[Mickey Fondozzi]], a repentant Mafia soldier whom Frank recruits to his side. The two work on operations together, such as infiltrating the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], a multi-faceted criminal organization.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #307-309; \'\'Nomad\'\' #4-6; \'\'The Punisher War Journal\'\' #46-48. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Punisher is seemingly killed in a failed ambush of an underworld meeting, the two find themselves literally on the street, their vehicle surrounded by police. When Micro refuses to help Mickey blast his way through the cops to escape, the latter abandons him.<ref>\'\'The Punisher War Zone\'\' #23 (Jan. 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUltimately, Castle and Micro have one final fallout just before the cancellation of all three major Punisher titles in 1995. This fight comes to an end in the closing issues of \'\'The Punisher War Journal\'\'. Micro disagrees with Castle\'s increasingly violent methods, feeling that Castle has lost sight of their original goals and has gone too far for even him to tolerate. He decides to recruit a new "Punisher" to replace Castle, former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] Carlos Cruz. Micro and Castle come face to face in one of Micro\'s safehouses in what appears to be a final confrontation. A gun battle ensues between the two former partners. This battle is interrupted by rogue [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Derek "Stone Cold" Smalls, who had been part of a program to take down vigilantes like Castle before becoming a vigilante himself. Smalls fires a rocket into the safe house, apparently killing Micro. Castle moves on, unsure if he would have really slain his old friend himself.<ref>\'\'The Punisher War Journal\'\' #79 (June 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the \'\'Civil War Files\'\' comic, just before the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline was published, [[Iron Man]] talked about events in the Punisher\'s past from the [[The Punisher (2001 series)|Marvel Knights]] and [[The Punisher (2004 series)|MAX comics]], which indicated that it did happen in the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] at some point, meaning that Punisher killing Micro in the MAX series is also considered canonical to [[Earth-616]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Title=Civil War Files|Issue=#1|Date=2006|Publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2008 - 09 "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" storyline, [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] brings Microchip back from the dead and offers to bring his son back to life if he helps in dealing with the Punisher.<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 7 #4-5.

Unfortunately, the Punisher refuses to help and threatens to use [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]] to burn them alive. The death of Bridge succeeds in reanimating the corpses, but the Punisher, believing that his family is not actually present, forces Firebrand to destroy the bodies, then kills the villain.<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 7 #10 (Dec. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the \'\'[[Punisher: In the Blood]]\'\' mini-series, the Punisher returns to New York City and vows to find Micro and make him pay for murdering G.W. Bridge. Micro is shown being knocked unconscious by [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]].<ref>\'\'Punisher: In the Blood\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While being held captive in Jigsaw\'s warehouse hideout, he is visited by [[Rampage (Marvel Comics)|Stuart Clarke]], an old ally of the Punisher.

However, he returns to attempt to pressure Castle into working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA\'s]] [[black ops]] unit to participate in the hunt for terrorists. The Punisher declines, as he prefers his autonomy to indentured service to an institution such as the government. Microchip confesses to Castle that the source of funding for the operation came from the CIA funneling arms and [[heroin]] out of [[Afghanistan]]. Castle gives Micro a chance he has not given his victims since before he officially assumed the role of the Punisher: the chance to run. Microchip declines, obligated to help Castle in a CIA/[[American Mafia|Mafia]] firefight. Taking a possibly mortal injury in the fight, Micro attempts to humanize Castle again, only to be met with a point-blank shotgun round to the head.<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 5 #6</ref><ref name="MGN">{{cite book|author = Robert G.
