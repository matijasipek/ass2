This is a reference to the fact that her brother [[Genis-Vell]]\'s name comes from [[genus]], one of the other classifications for life forms.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:Phyla-Vell.png|thumb|upright|Phyla-Vell as Captain Marvel. \'\'[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]\'\' #17 (Feb. 2004). Art by [[Paul Azaceta]].]]\nAfter [[Genis-Vell]], then known as Captain Marvel, previously destroyed and recreated the universe, the "new" version was subtly altered with Phyla-Vell\'s existence being one of the changes. It is revealed that she is the second artificially created offspring of Captain Mar-Vell who was created by her mother [[Elysius]] in the "new" universe because her first attempt (Genis-Vell) had been so successful. Initially her origin conflicted with previously established storylines, but this is resolved in \'\'Captain Marvel\'\' vol. 5 #18 (Feb. 2004).\n\nShe fights her brother Genis-Vell, who was insane at the time,<ref>\'\'Captain Marvel\'\' vol. 5 #17-18 (Jan.–Feb. 2004)</ref> in the process helping to restore his sanity. She then tries to lay claim to the "Captain Marvel" title, though her brother refuses to give it up.<ref>\'\'Captain Marvel\'\' vol. 5 #19 (March 2004)</ref> Phyla is next seen at the trial of [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]].<ref>\'\'She-Hulk\'\' #12-13, 2006</ref>\n\nThe \'\'Captain Marvel\'\' (vol. 5) series heavily hinted that Phyla-Vell is a [[lesbian]], and in #25 (September 2004) the character admits that she is attracted to [[Moondragon]] and invites her on a tour of the "[[spiral nebula]] near Renault VII". Before Moondragon can accept the two wander through a portal.<ref>\'\'Captain Marvel\'\' vol. 5 #25</ref>\n\n===Annihilation===\n{{Main|Annihilation (comics)}}\nPhyla later appeared during \'\'[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]\'\' where she had been visiting her father\'s grave with Moondragon when the pair were attacked by [[Thanos]] who ripped off Moondragon\'s ear and gave it to Phyla, telling her to go to [[Drax the Destroyer]] and how his actions would determine Moondragon\'s fate shortly before teleporting away with Moondragon. Drax has indicated he will not be stopping his pursuit of Thanos.<ref>\'\'Annihilation\'\' #2</ref>\n\nPhyla then goes with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and [[Star-Lord]] to lead a final battle against [[Annihilus]], being saved at the last second by a massive energy wave caused by the just freed [[Galactus]], which left only the three heroes and Annihilus as survivors.  Ultimately in the battle, Phyla manages to steal away the [[quantum bands]] that Annihilus took from [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], weakening him and allowing Nova to finally bring an end to the Annihilation Wave.  She is then seen re-united with Moondragon, and deciding it\'s up to her to become the new Quasar.<ref>\'\'Annihilation\'\' #6</ref>\n\n===Annihilation: Conquest&nbsp;– Quasar===\n{{See also|Annihilation: Conquest}}\nPhyla had her own mini-series as the new Quasar, stating July through October 2007, called \'\'[[Annihilation: Conquest]]&nbsp;– Quasar\'\'. The series was written by [[Christos Gage]] (who wrote \'\'[[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]]\'\'), penciled by [[Mike Lilly]]. Phyla is finding it hard to follow the footsteps of the former Quasar and also to follow in the Mar-Vell family\'s footsteps. The story is a lot about her trying to handle this power, and seeing if she can contain it.  She\'s on a quest, and the object of the quest has real importance, not only to her, but to the entire storyline. Phylla and her lover Moondragon follow a voice to find the saviour for the [[Kree]] race who is attacked by the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]]. In the end it turns out \'the voice\' is the [[Supreme Intelligence]] of the Kree; thanks to the Supreme Intelligence they find a cocoon, in which [[Adam Warlock]] is restoring. The cocoon breaks open and Phyla and Moondragon ask Warlock to help them fight against the Phalanx.

After losing the Quantum Bands to Maelstrom Phyla is offered as a sacrifice to the Dragon so that Maelstrom can be in its good graces. While inside the dragon she apparently makes a deal in exchange for Heather Douglas. The dragon then releases them, with Phyla wearing a new red and black costume adorned with skulls and wielding a new sword, and they return to the world of the living where Phyla refuses to elaborate on the deal that she made with the Dragon. It is later learned from Maelstrom that she agreed to become the new avatar of Oblivion.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2 #12</ref>\n\n===Martyr===\nNow calling herself Martyr, Phyla-Vell is a more abrasive and aggressive figure. When the Guardians attempted to negotiate with the Inhumans to stop the War of Kings, she ruined the attempt by taking [[Crystal (comics)|Inhuman princess Crystal]] hostage instead; this led to battle between the Inhumans and Guardians, while she continued to escalate.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2 #14</ref> Eventually, the Inhumans would try to end the war by detonating a weapon that shattered space itself, creating a multiversal Fault.<ref>\'\'War of Kings\'\' #6</ref>\n\nWhen [[Adam Warlock]] stopped the Fault\'s growth by using a redundant timeline, one where he became the villainous [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], Phyla-Vell revealed that her deal with Oblivion was to kill "the Avatar of Life" and she\'d know what to do when the time came. Knowing he would now become Magus, she ran Adam through but this failed to stop his transformation. Several of the Guardians, then stranded in the year 3009, were then sent back in time to stop Magus\' creation and Phyla was prevented from making her move.
