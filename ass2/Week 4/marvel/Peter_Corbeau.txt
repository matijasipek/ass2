When the army manages to capture Hulk with tranquilizer bombs, they bring him to Dr. Peter Corbeau.

Peter manages to pilot the shuttle into the space station.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #99</ref> The space station\'s owner [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]] informs the captive Professor X, Peter Corbeau, Cyclops, and [[Jean Grey]] that he went over the Sentinel notes and was given a funding from the Council of the Chosen to start Project: Armageddon in order to wipe out the mutant race. During Steven Lang\'s ranting, Cyclops frees himself from his containment and then frees the others. When the space station is about to explode, Peter Corbeau states that anyone who could pilot the crippled Starcore shuttle by a solar flare would be irradiated. Jean Grey pulls out the knowledge of flying a ship from Peter Corbeau\'s mind and uses her telepathy to surround the ship as it passes by a solar flare.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #100</ref> When the shuttle crashes into Jamaica Bay, the X-Men and Peter Corbeau swim to the surface as Jean Grey emerges as the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]].
