She is the daughter of mutant [[Aboriginal Australians|Indigenous Australian]] refugees (their ancestor is the mutant [[Gateway (comics)|Gateway]]) who fled Australia for America the day before it was devastated in a nuclear attack. Shard was born and raised in a mutant concentration camp, in which mutants were branded over their right eyes with the letter "M" for recognition. In [[Uncanny X-Men]] Annual #17, Shard is stated as having the mutant ability of "transubbing ambient light into concussive force".{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nShard became the youngest X.S.E. graduate a year after Bishop attained that position. She served under Bishop as a member of the Omega Squad (which included Bishop and his officers, Randall and Malcolm), until her promotion.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nTogether, in the X.S.E. Shard and Bishop were responsible for apprehending criminal mutants. Shard was partially infected on a mission with her brother fighting a group infected with a vampire-like affliction originating from the present day mutant, [[Emplate]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nAlthough Emplates are considered the "living dead", Bishop took her to the New York Stark/Fujikawa building inhabited by the [[Alternative versions of Gambit#Bishop\'future|Witness]] in order to attempt to save her life by transmitting her essence into a holographic matrix (a technology of [[Shi\'ar]] origin, akin to that used in the X-Men\'s [[Danger Room]]). Here he was said to have made a deal in order for the experiment to even happen in the first place, the price being that he would work for him for a specified period of time. The experiment was a success, but Shard, already partially infected with the Emplate affliction, died. Due to the process involved, Bishop considered himself her murderer.{{issue|date=December 2012}} The extent of, as well as the type of work he did in this deal is still yet to be known, if it ever will be.<ref>\'\'Messiah Complex\'\' TPB</ref>\n\nBishop eventually travelled back in time, to the present, in an effort to track down [[Trevor Fitzroy]], one of his time\'s most-wanted criminals and Shard\'s ex-lover, where he became stuck in the present day and became a member of the [[X-Men]], his idols. Shard has also since been recreated in the present, as a computer construct, and became a clandestine member of the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team. There, she began a romantic relationship with her teammate [[Wildchild (comics)|Wildchild]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nAfter X-Factor disbanded in \'\'X-Factor #149\'\', Shard was transported into an alternate future. There she died for the second and apparently final time, saving her brother Bishop from Trevor Fitzroy. Her former paramour had attempted to seduce her by restoring her body to its original solid form.<ref>\'\'Bishop: the Last X-Man #14\'\'</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nShard is able to absorb ambient light particles and convert/transsub it to allow her to perform a number of light based attacks. During Shard\'s condition living as a photon based life form, she is granted a form of intangibility.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television=== \n* Shard appears in the \'\'[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men]]\'\' episodes "One Man\'s Worth" pt. 1 & 2 and "Beyond Good and Evil" pt. 1-4. She was voiced by [[Kay Tremblay]].\n\n===Video games===\n* In \'\'[[X-Men: Mojo World]]\'\' she is a playable character after unlocked in level 4.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/08/20/shard-bishop/ World of Black Heroes: Shard Biography]\n*[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=941 Uncannyxmen.net character bio on Shard]\n\n{{John Romita Jr.}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shard (Comics)}}\n\n[[Category:Australian superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Jr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1994]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate light]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible]]\n[[Category:Fictional indigenous people of Australia]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics orphans]]\n[[Category:X-Factor (comics)]]\n[[Category:Fictional lieutenants]]\n[[Category:Fictional female lieutenants]]'}]}}}}
