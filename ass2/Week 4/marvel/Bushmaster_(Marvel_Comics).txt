In the United States, he was confronted by [[Misty Knight]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]. Due to an accident during a fight with Power Man, Bushmaster was transformed into "Unliving metal", which later led to his death.\n\nThe second Bushmaster (Quincy McIver), first appeared in \'\'[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]\'\' #310 (October 1985), created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]]. Quincy McIver, younger brother of John, lost both his arms and legs in a boating accident while trying to avoid the police. The [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]] used their resources to graft bionic arms to Quincy\'s body and replace his severed legs with a long bionic snake tail, transforming him into Bushmaster. He became a founding member of the [[Serpent Society]], finding acceptance among the team. He would remain loyal to Society leader [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] when [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] took control of the Serpent Society. He was not shown to be a member of Serpent Solutions when the Society was reorganized.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===John McIver===\n{{Infobox comics character\n| image =\n| caption =\n| character_name = Bushmaster \n| real_name = John McIver\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| debut = \'\'[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]\'\' #15 (Sept. 1977)\n| creators = [[Chris Claremont]]<br>[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]\n| alliances = [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]\n| aliases = John Bushmaster, Power Master\n| powers = \'\'\'As Bushmaster:\'\'\'<br>Skilled street fighter<br>Superhuman strength and durability<br><br>\'\'\'As Power Master:\'\'\'<br>Energy absorption \n}}\n\nJohn McIver was a powerful crime boss, criminal financier and organizer, and the brother of Quincy McIver. As a teenager, John and Quincy grew up on an unidentified island in the Caribbean Sea. Unlike Quincy, John was quick and savvy enough to stay out of trouble, despite stealing from local [[merchant]]s. After John found out that Quincy blurted out that they were brothers to a [[shopkeeper]] who had caught him, John gave Quincy a beating. A few nights later, John beat the shopkeeper to death. Years later, John was in the employ of Herve Argosy where he worked as his muscle man in his gun-extorting business. John got Quincy in with Herve Argosy, but Quincy got all four limbs chopped off by a motorboat propeller on the first mission. John visited Quincy in the hospital to mock his misfortune. John McIver then took on the name John Bushmaster and headed off to Europe to run some of Argosy\'s trade there.<ref name="Captain America #10">\'\'Captain America Annual\'\' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, John Bushmaster managed to take over the European branch of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. As he began to show interest into expanding into the United States starting with New York, he attracted the attention of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], and [[Interpol]] where they have failed to infiltrate his organization. New York\'s [[district attorney]] sent [[Misty Knight]] to take a stab at it under the alias of Maya Korday. She did so successfully. Bushmaster returned early from his press conference and warmly greeted Maya at the Cutlass Bay resort on the Caribbean island of Ste. Emile.<ref>\'\'Iron Fist\'\' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBushmaster agreed to put a hit out on [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] for a man named Shrieve. Discovering this, an enraged Maya  used her bionic arm to force Bushmaster to tell her where the hit would occur. Maya then went to a boat where Bushmaster planned to see her dead.<ref>\'\'Marvel Team-Up\'\' #63. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBushmaster sent his agents to capture [[Claire Temple]] and [[Noah Burstein]]. Bushmaster summoned [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] to his mansion at [[Lake Michigan]] where he showed them the videos of the hostages and threatened to kill them if they didn\'t bring Misty Knight to him. In exchange, Bushmaster offered to give them videotapes provided by a technology user named Gadget that would prove his innocence for the crimes that Luke Cage was initially framed for. To make sure that Power Man followed his offer, Bushmaster sent [[Shades (comics)|Shades]] and [[Comanche (comics)|Comanche]] to follow them.<ref name="Power Man #49">\'\'Power Man\'\' #49. Marvel Comics.</ref> Power Man ended up fighting Misty Knight, [[Colleen Wing]], and Iron Fist. When Luke Cage was seemingly defeated by Iron Fist, Shades and Comanche reported this to Bushmaster.<ref>\'\'Power Man\'\' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> At Seagate Prison, Bushmaster coerced Noah Burnstein into utilizing the "Power Man" process on him to an even greater extent that was used on Luke Cage. Power Man, Iron Fist, Misty Knight, and Colleen Wing fought Bushmaster at Seagate Prison where Bushmaster proved to be more powerful than Luke Cage. In the course of the battle, Power Man and Bushmaster pierced a chemical vat and were doused in chemicals which were then electrified by a torn power line. Bushmaster was believed killed in the resulting explosion.<ref name="Power Man #49"/>\n\nBushmaster survived and his body continued to mutate, transforming into unliving metal. While he still could move, Bushmaster had his agents capture Noah Burnstein\'s wife Emma to force Noah to reverse the process. His agents also captured Power Man and brought him to Seagate to be used as a guinea pig. Virtually immobile, Bushmaster watched as Noah Burnstein began the process. When Iron Fist arrived and shattered the tank to rescue Power Man, Bushmaster reached for a signal switch to order his men to kill Emma Burnstein, but as he did, his transformation accelerated and left him in an immobile inert steel form less than an inch from the switch. His body then began to crumble leaving only a metal skeleton.<ref>\'\'Power Man\'\' #67. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBushmaster\'s son Cruz Bushmaster had his father\'s remains taken to an island fortress off the coast of St. Croix so that he can have Noah Burnstein resolve the safety issues in the "Power Man" process. Cruz Bushmaster had his father\'s remains and Luke Cage placed in a chamber to absorb the negative effects of the "Power Man" process. John Bushmaster was revived by the energies and took over Cruz\'s body. John Bushmaster in Cruz\' body goes by the name Power Master and attacks Luke Cage. In the nick of time, Iron Fist arrived and freed Luke Cage from Power Master\'s grip. Luke Cage then puts a power cable into Power Master who ends up soaking up the energy like a sponge. As Power Master started absorbing too much energy, Luke Cage and Iron Fist escaped while Cruz Bushmaster\'s fortress exploded.<ref>\'\'Cage\'\' #12.

He took the name "Bushmaster" from his fallen brother. Years later, [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] enlisted Bushmaster to join the criminal trade union known as the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #310. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bushmaster was grateful for the unity and the steady employment. After all, he considered himself to be a freak, and the Society was his best chance in life. In fact, he made a friend in [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], a fellow Society member.\n\nIn his first mission with the Serpent Society, he was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] to hunt down [[MODOK]]. MODOK severed Bushmaster\'s artificial appendages, and Diamondback saved Bushmaster\'s life.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #312-313</ref> He soon received new bionic arms.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #319.

He was poisoned by the Viper, but was saved by [[Captain America]] and Diamondback.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #341-342.
