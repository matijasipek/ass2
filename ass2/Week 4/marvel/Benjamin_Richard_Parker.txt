The character was depicted in the alternate future [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. He is the younger brother of [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|May Parker / Spider-Girl]], and the son of [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] and [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBenjamin was born after a [[Complications of pregnancy|complicated]] pregnancy.  Because his father\'s genetic code was altered when he received his powers, Ben was at a high risk of being born with some kind of genetic abnormality: [[deformity]], [[disability]], or perhaps even [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers.<ref name="PPSM15">The [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] of the X-Men, a noted geneticist, explained the probable risks to Spider-Man in \'\'[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]\'\' #15, October 1991, by writer/artist [[Erik Larsen]].</ref>  Due to the risk to Mary Jane\'s health, her [[Obstetrics|obstetrician]] advised her to consider [[abortion]]. However, remembering that she had faced similar risks when pregnant with her daughter, May, Mary Jane decided to proceed with the pregnancy.<ref>\'\'Spider-Girl\'\' #40</ref>\n\nBen was born while his sister was fighting [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]], and to his family\'s relief, was apparently a perfectly healthy, normal little boy.  His first name, \'\'\'Benjamin,\'\'\' is in honor of his [[Ben Reilly|uncle]] and [[Uncle Ben|great uncle]], while his second name, \'\'\'Richard,\'\'\' is in honor of his [[Richard and Mary Parker|grandfather]].<ref>\'\'Spider-Girl\'\' #59</ref>\n\nBenjamin seemed to display some superhuman abilities. He had been able to balance a block toy while simultaneously spinning his arm very quickly.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Girl\'\' #9</ref>  He was also seen dangling the block from his finger on a web-like string.{{issue|date=January 2013}}  May discovered Ben crawling on the ceiling of their home.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Girl\'\' #14</ref>\n\nHe was once possessed by a miniature version of the [[Carnage (character)|Carnage]] symbiote.  After his sister freed him from the symbiote by using the ultrasonic weaponry of the villain [[Reverb (comics)|Reverb]], his father noticed that the baby\'s ears were bleeding, and realized that Ben had lost his hearing, likely because Ben\'s ears were far too underdeveloped to withstand the sonic waves.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Girl\'\' #11-12</ref>  The doctors in the hospital tried to determine whether Ben\'s hearing loss was temporary or permanent.  May was deeply upset over this and blames herself.  Nevertheless, Ben still seemed to be his usual, happy self.  Since discovering her baby brother crawling on the ceiling, she fears that due to his exposure to the symbiote, his abilities had somehow been jump started far too early (as hers only came about in her teens).{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[Normie Osborn]] agreed to fund an operation to restore Benjamin\'s hearing. The operation was a success, restoring most, if not all of Ben\'s hearing. When Benjy was going through it, Normie closely examined his body and found out that he was already developing his powers, but the exposure to the symbiote accelerated the process. Peter began to fear that Benjamin may be more powerful than him and his sister. This is strongly implied to be true when Ben spins organic webs to save both himself and Mary Jane after being thrown off a bridge by the [[Green Goblin]], something neither Peter nor May can do. Despite being a baby, he was also strong enough for Mary Jane to hold on to without hurting him.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Girl\'\' #30</ref>\n\nIt is also known that Peter was the only one who could get him to burp "in the morning" (as Mary Jane says it) by feeding him chili.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Spider-Verse===\nIn the 2014/2015 crossover event \'\'[[Spider-Verse]]\'\', Benjy\'s family happened to be under attack from [[Daemos]], a relation of the 616 Spider-Man\'s former nemesis [[Morlun]]. During the attack, Mary Jane, Mayday\'s boyfriend Wes, and Peter are apparently all killed and their home destroyed. Mayday flees with Ben and is rescued by visiting Spider-Men from other dimensions who were trying to save as many Spiders as possible from similar attacks by Morlon and Daemos\' family, who called themselves "The Inheritors". Mayday and Ben were taken to a safe zone where the Spiders planned their next course of action. The safe zone was eventually compromised and Ben is captured by The Inheritors. It was revealed that Ben is vital part of a prophecy that would help bring about the downfall of The Inheritors and involved "The Other" (Kaine), "The Bride" (Silk) and "The Scion" (Ben himself). However, conversely if the three specific totems were sacrificed together, their deaths would ensure that not only The Inheritors remain in power forever, but it would also stop future spider-people from appearing, and thus preventing the prophecy. Benjy is eventually saved by [[Uncle Ben#Spider-Verse|Ben Parker]]- his great-uncle, and possible namesake, and [[Spider-Ham]], in the final fight, Uncle Ben takes Benjy to safety and Spider-Ham takes Benjy\'s place to catch The Inheritors off-guard.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol.3 #14</ref> Afterwards, it is revealed Benjamin\'s mother and Wes survived the Inheritor attacked, but unfortunately, his father did not.\n\n===Web Warriors===\n\nBenjamin made a few cameo appearances in 2015\'s [[Web Warriors]] series, looked after by Mayday, Mary Jane, Uncle Ben and often visited by Anya Corzon.\n\n===Spider-Geddon===\n\nBenjamin is referenced several times by his sister Mayday in the event [[Spider-Geddon]]. After the latest battle with The Inheritors has concluded, Mayday comments that her brother is very likely still the Scion of the Spider-Scroll Prophecy, her alternate world sister Annie May Parker, Spiderling, informed her that The Other was still in play too and was closer than she knew. On Mayday and Benjamin\'s Earth, it is revealed that The Other had resurrected their father.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Universe X===\nOn [[Earth X]], when Spider-Man, an African American villain mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]], attacked a middle aged Peter using his web illusions and trapping Peter on a world of suffer, Peter took control of the illusion and fabricated a world where he had his ideal life, including his son Benjamin who had grown up and took the mantle of Spider-Man. Then [[Alternative versions of Venom#Earth X|Venom]], Peter\'s real life daughter, May, who had bonded to the Venom symbiote, defeated Spiders Man and broke her out of that fabricated world and convinced Peter to accept his real life.<ref>\'\'Universe X Special\'\' #3. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Arachnamorphosis===\nA version of Benjamin appears in \'\'What If?... Starring Spider-Man: Arachnamorphosis\'\', in which he is the son of Peter Parker and [[Gwen Stacy]]. In this reality Spider-Man\'s powers began to mutate him into a monster along with Ben who inherited traits from the spider powers.<ref>\'\'What If?\'\' Vol. 2 #88. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Peter and MJ happily ever after===\nIn this universe, Peter had overcome every hardship and he and his wife, Mary Jane, lived a good life, growing old along with their children, May and Ben.<ref>\'\'Sensational Spider-Man\'\' Vol. 2 #40. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Last Avenger===\nIn another universe, Ben was featured, where Spider-Man refused to join the Avengers.<ref>\'\'The Last Avengers Story\'\' #2. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Spider-Dreams===\nBenjamin, along with his family, (May, Mary Jane and Peter) got new identities with the help of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and moved away after Peter gave up being Spider-Man. He, along with his family, lived a full life and died of old age, while Peter, who gained longevity, outlived his own family.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #700. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Spider-Girl: The End===\nIn the alternate reality, where April had accidentally killed her sister, April started impersonating her dead sister, but Benji saw through her disguise and revealed it MJ.<ref>\'\'Spider-Girl: The End\'\' #1. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Adventures in Spidey-Baby-Sitting===\nIn this alternate universe, the son of Peter and MJ was born a spider-like human [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], but despite this, his parents still love him.<ref>\'\'What If?\'\' Vol. 2 #34. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===Spider-Man: Last Stand===\nIn the universe of \'\'Spider-Man: Last Stand\'\', Peter had a son named Ben.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #500.
