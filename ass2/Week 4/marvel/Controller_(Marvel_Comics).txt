Sandhurst worked as an electro-mechanical/chemical research scientist. His obsession with control brought his downfall as a scientist when his refusal to obey ethical restraints got him banned from most research facilities. Sandhurst was prone to fits of rage and in an attempt to calm him, his brother Vincent inadvertently triggered a lab explosion, crippling Basil.

He created an improved set of equipment but was again defeated by Iron Man.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMonths later, he was released from prison by the alien [[Thanos]], who upgraded his technology. Thanos promised the Controller rulership of Earth, and so he began enslaving dozens of operatives. He invaded [[Avengers Mansion]] and defeated the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]], and abducted Lou-Ann Savannah. The Controller\'s egotistical displays endangered Thanos\'s security, and when the Controller failed to defeat Thanos\'s enemy, Captain Marvel, the alien left him for dead.<ref>\'\'Captain Marvel\'\' #28, 30. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Controller went underground for years, upgrading via Stark technology stolen from [[Justin Hammer]], and eventually enslaved a cult. He set the [[Blood Brothers (comics)|Blood Brothers]] against Iron Man and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. Iron Man defeated him and imprisoned him in a vat of experimental plastic, but he escaped. Alongside one of the Blood Brothers, he fought Iron Man, but Iron Man defeated him once more and he was confined to the prison for supervillains called the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]].<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #88-91. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually broke out of jail, only to be defeated by Iron Man again. During the "[[Acts of Vengeance]]," the Controller escaped from the Vault and at the behest of the [[Red Skull]], he enslaved [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and set him against [[Captain America]]. He unsuccessfully attempted to control [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] at the behest of the Red Skull, and unsuccessfully attempted to aid the Red Skull against [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. He was ultimately defeated by Captain America.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #365-367. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nRevived by the world-conquering [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]], the Controller became the Master\'s pawn against the Avengers and [[Heroes for Hire]]. Abandoned after a later defeat, the Controller, in an ironic nod to his many hospitalizations, acquired his own clinic, where he influenced the wealthy to do his bidding. However, the Controller could not resist enslaving [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] as well, leading to his latest defeat by Iron Man.\n\nReturned to The Raft, the Controller escaped with dozens of others but was recaptured during a clash with the [[U-Foes]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name="Avengers.">{{\ncite book\n|title=The New Avengers: Most Wanted Files\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Super-Human Registration Act.

After the Avengers defeat the first wave of Leviathon monsters, the Controller tries to put a control disc on Thor, but he is stopped by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' Vol. 7 #1.MU.

Tony and his allies were able to trace Controller\'s location and head there to confront him. By the time they arrived, Iron Man found that Controller had consumed enough energy to grow in size.<ref>\'\'Tony Stark: Iron Man\'\' #7.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Controller designed his armored exoskeleton, which is micro-surgically attached to his body from head to toe and grants him mobility, as well as superhuman strength and endurance.\n\nHe uses "slave discs" to control others, using the micro-circuitry in his helmet to drain cerebral energy from his victims to power his exoskeleton and magnify its strength and duplicate his victim\'s abilities. He has limited psychokinetic and telepathic abilities, the ability to control the actions of any one person wearing one of his slave discs, and the ability to fire mental bolts of force from his helmet. He can psionically control "weak-willed" subjects even without his discs. He flies via boot-jets and has employed image inducers, stun mists, and other technology as needed.<ref name="needed.">{{cite book|title=The New Avengers: Most Wanted Files}}</ref>\n\nThe Controller originally used a mental wave Absorbatron to convert cerebral energies for use by his exoskeleton, though this device was rendered obsolete after [[Thanos]] improved the Controller\'s equipment. The discs now increase his physical attributes in geometric progression to numbers of victims wearing slave discs, and he was able to control the actions of all persons wearing the discs.\n\nThe Controller is a highly skilled chemist and mechanical engineer, with a college degree in chemistry and electrical and mechanical engineering.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the \'\'[[Earth X]]\'\' reality, Sandhurst was mentioned as one of the many who were killed when [[Norman Osborn]] rose to power.<ref>\'\'Earth X\'\' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Controller appears in the \'\'[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]\'\' episode "Armor Wars, Part 1", voiced by Jamie Horton. Using [[Iron Man]]\'s technology, he creates slave discs to mentally control his armor, which he uses on executives who visited the Center for Achievement and Bliss Spa. Once he learns of this, Iron Man defeats the Controller and uses a negator pack to destroy his armor.\n* The Controller appears in the \'\'[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]\'\', voiced by [[Michael Kopsa]]. Introduced in the episode "Ready, A.I.M., Fire", this version is a skilled [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] scientist. While helping them create [[MODOK]], he works with Tony Stark to create his slave discs and a control helmet. Despite being defeated by Iron Man, the Controller reminds A.I.M.\'s [[Scientist Supreme]] of his expertise and usefulness in completing the MODOK project to keep his leader from terminating him. In "Designed Only For Chaos", the Controller activates MODOK, who knocks him unconscious after foreseeing he will betray A.I.M. in pursuit of improving his slave discs. In "Uncontrollable", the Controller pursues the [[Hulk]] and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] in order to use them to take revenge against A.I.M., only to gain control of Iron Man in his [[Hulkbuster armor|Dynamo Buster]] Armor. Via Iron Man, he attacks A.I.M. and defeats MODOK, though with the Hulk\'s help, Iron Man\'s allies are able to free him from the Controller\'s control. In "Control+Alt+Delete", A.I.M. frees the Controller from the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]] so he can help them trap Iron Man in a virtual reality world called the Mainframe. Using this, he discovers Iron Man\'s secret identity and use of the [[Extremis]] serum and attempts to recreate it for A.I.M. However, Iron Man is able to use his Extremis abilities to hack the Mainframe and shut it down. Waking up in an A.I.M. facility, the Controller takes control of [[War Machine]] to fight Iron Man, but the former is able to fight the disc and overload the Controller\'s helmet. Following the fight, Iron Man and War Machine hand over an amnesiac Controller to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\n\n===Video games===\n* Two Controllers, both named \'\'\'Control\'\'\', appear in \'\'[[Captain America and the Avengers]]\'\'.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Controller appears in the [[Wii]] version of the 2008 \'\'[[Iron Man (video game)|Iron Man]]\'\' game, voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} This iteration is an agent of A.I.M. who leads an attack on a U.S. military ship to seize its nuclear reactor.
