The Hand had almost overpowered the small band of warriors, when Stick and Shaft resorted to an ancient technique that drained the life force from all ninja present. Unfortunately, the technique resulted in the explosion and deaths of Stick and his comrade as a result of the excess energy they had absorbed.

The Hand severely harmed Stick\'s soldiers, reducing their number to a handful of warriors. The few Chaste remaining traveled to New York, seeking the assistance of Daredevil who reluctantly aided his former mentor\'s disciples.

This proves to be Stick\'s undoing, as Elektra tracks Danny down to the hideout and attacks Stick. After a short sword fight, Elektra disarms her former sensei, and just as Matt and Jessica arrive, she stabs him to death in spite of Matt\'s attempts to talk her down. She then knocks out Matt, Luke and Jessica in quick succession, and escapes with Danny by jumping out a window.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Ashes, Ashes|series=The Defenders|credits=Surjik, Stephen (director); Drew Goddard & Marco Ramirez (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=August 18, 2017|season=1|number=6}}</ref> Matt is devastated by Stick\'s death and in a perpetual state of shock when recounting the incident to Foggy later on.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Fish in the Jailhouse|series=The Defenders|credits=Alcal√°, F√©lix Enr√≠quez (director); Lauren Schmidt Hissrich & Marco Ramirez (writer)|network=[[Netflix]]|airdate=August 18, 2017|season=1|number=7}}</ref> \n** Glenn revealed that [[Jeph Loeb]] had told him that Stick could still return in future Marvel projects despite the character\'s death; saying "I remember Jeph saying, \'We\'re in the Marvel Universe. If Elektra kills you, that doesn\'t necessarily mean you\'re dead.\' And I said, \'Okay.\' But for me, the show is over, unless I get a phone call, and then it will or won\'t [continue] depending on the deal and all of that stuff. It\'s hard to answer that question [would he be interested in reprising the role]. All of that stuff really lies with the script writer and with lines, and do I really want to go back and deal with those contact lenses again? I don\'t know. It\'s an impossible question to answer."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/defenders-scott-glenn-sticks-future-1032576| title=\'The Defenders\' Star Scott Glenn Teases Potential Return to the Marvel Universe| publisher=The Hollywood Reporter | date=August 25, 2017 | access-date=August 25, 2017 | last=Wigler | first=Josh | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Animation====\n* Stick appears in the \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]\'\' episode "Framed".
