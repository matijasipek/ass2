The Marauders did succeed in annihilating a large number of the underground mutants. While the Marauders were accomplishing this, they also clashed with the X-Men,<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #210–213 (October 1986–January 1987)</ref> [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]],<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #10 (November 1986)</ref> [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #374 (December 1986)</ref> and [[Power Pack]].<ref>\'\'Power Pack\'\' #27 (December 1986)</ref> With the Marauders, she also attempted to kill [[Madelyne Pryor]].<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #221 (September 1987)</ref>\n\nSinister later sent Vertigo along with the other Marauders to fight the X-Men in New York City just before the extra-dimensional incursion known as the "[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]".<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #240 (January 1989)</ref> She was apparently killed in battle with the X-Men.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #241 (February 1989)</ref> Her alliance with Sinister was short-lived at that time, as she soon rejoined her Savage Land Mutate allies.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nSaid allies join with the more peaceful of the Land\'s inhabitants to resist a territorial grab by humanoid saurians.

This power induces effects ranging from mild disorientation and vertigo to unconsciousness. Vertigo can focus her power on one or more individuals, or project it outward from herself in all directions, affecting everyone within her range of influence.\n\nVertigo is not immune to her own powers, as she was thrown off balance when [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] reflected her psychic waves back at her with [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]].\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of X===\nIn the \'\'[[Age of X]]\'\' reality Vertigo appeared as an X-Man.<ref>\'\'X-Men Legacy\'\' #245</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Vertigo appeared in \'\'[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]\'\', voiced by Megan Smith.
