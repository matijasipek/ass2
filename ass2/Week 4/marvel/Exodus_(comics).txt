As an adult he was a crusader and became best friends with Eobar Garrington, the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]] of that era. The two had set out on a quest to find the Tower of Power, the domain of the mythic "Eternal Pharaoh" in [[Aqaba]] when Dane Whitman (the 20th century [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]) and [[Sersi]] had been transported back to the 12th century, Whitman transported into Eobar\'s body. Eobar retained control, but felt something was wrong. When he came into contact with Sersi, he abandoned the quest, angering du Paris, who then left to find the tower alone. Traveling for hours through violent sandstorms, when he finally collapsed, a voice spoke to him, asking him if he was willing to risk everything to become one of the strong. Du Paris was then tested, and his mutant powers manifested for the first time. Proving himself strong, he disappeared from the spot.\n\nMeanwhile, Sersi had awakened Dane\'s mind and he now had control of his body as Eobar passed on. While searching for du Paris, the two were captured by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. When they awoke they found Bennet du Paris had been transformed into Exodus, recognizing him as the same Exodus from the 20th century. Apocalypse commanded Exodus to destroy the Black Knight. When Dane refused to kill Exodus, Sersi intervened, though her attack proved useless. Apocalypse again commanded Exodus to kill Sersi and Dane, though this time Exodus refused. He turned on Apocalypse, calling him a "false god". Apocalypse stripped Exodus of his power and sealed him away in a crypt in the [[Swiss Alps]].\n\nSix months later, Dane found the crypt in which Exodus was trapped and in a coma-like state. He found there was a curse preventing Exodus from leaving, yet others were allowed to come and go as they pleased. Dane left guards who had sworn to look after the crypt for generations to come, and he and Sersi returned to their time.\n\n===Acolytes===\nSometime later, in the 20th century, [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] found and freed Exodus, taking him back to [[Providence (comics)|Avalon]]. Exodus became Magneto\'s right-hand man, replacing [[Fabian Cortez]], who had betrayed Magneto. Exodus appeared before the government sanctioned team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] (his first actual appearance). It seemed as though Exodus wanted to tell them something, but he refrained and left.<ref name="X#92">\'\'[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]\'\' #92</ref>\n\nExodus then appeared before the mutant team [[X-Force]] to take [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] to Avalon with him. They declined, but the team proved no match for Exodus. Exodus was followed back, and X-Force invaded Avalon to rescue their teammates. The whole of X-Force fled the station, but not before [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] was mortally wounded by Magneto.<ref>\'\'[[X-Force (comics)|X-Force]]\'\' #25</ref>\n\nWhen [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] wiped Magneto\'s mind clean in an attack by the X-Men on Avalon, Exodus assumed leadership of the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]]. Exodus would converse with the mindless Magneto, believing he could hear Magneto\'s voice.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #26</ref>\n\nSoon after, Fabian Cortez had resurfaced in [[Genosha]], where he had taken Magneto\'s granddaughter [[Luna (comics)|Luna]] prisoner. The tension between the mutants and humans there had erupted and Genosha was in a state of war. When Luna\'s mother [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] realized Luna had been taken, she and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] left for Genosha.<ref name="A#369">\'\'[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]\'\' #368</ref>\nMeanwhile, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[X-Men]] had also gone to Genosha to save Luna. Exodus arrived in Genosha to save the mutant people and destroy the humans. He quickly came to blows with the Avengers, defeating both [[War Machine]] and Sersi before leaving. Exodus then found Fabian Cortez in the sewers of Genosha, using the baby Luna as a human shield. Cortez tried his best to escape, telling Quicksilver, [[Scarlet Witch]], Crystal, and [[Jean Grey]] they must kill Exodus in exchange for Luna\'s life.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #307</ref> They were no match for Exodus, however, and he took control of Cortez, making him hand over Luna and seemingly killing him.<ref name="Avengers #369">\'\'The Avengers\'\' #369</ref>\n\nExodus then appeared to the mutants of Genosha, telling them to kill all humans or the entire island would be crushed under his [[force field (fiction)|force field]]. The Avengers and X-Men teamed up and took the fight to Exodus, but it proved futile. It was not until Professor Xavier unleashed a powerful psionic attack on Exodus that Black Knight was able to sneak up on Exodus, cutting through him with his energy blade. Exodus, weakened and defeated, left for Avalon, but not before unleashing a powerful attack on Quicksilver. It was also revealed during this battle that Black Knight remembered Exodus, but not from where or when.<ref name="Avengers #369"/>\n\n===Exodus vs. Holocaust===\nThe Acolytes discovered a cocoon of ice with a living being inside floating near Avalon. Despite some Acolyte\'s objections, Exodus ordered the cocoon to be brought on board, believing it to be a sign of things to come. This, together with his insistence that he hears Magneto\'s voice and refusal to show Magneto\'s body, made some Acolytes doubt his sanity. During the night the being inhabiting the cocoon awoke and absorbed several Acolytes, killing them. The being turned out to be [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]], one of the survivors of the altered reality the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. Holocaust confused Exodus with his AoA counterpart. Holocaust knew that he was among enemies when he heard of Magneto\'s presence. Exodus and Holocaust battled without regard for anything around them, destroying Avalon and sending its remnants to Earth.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #42-43</ref>\n\nSeverely weakened from his battle with Holocaust, Exodus made his way back to the crypt in the Swiss Alps where Apocalypse had originally locked him away. Exodus hoped to rest and regain his powers there, but discovered that his powers had somehow changed. Exodus became a kind of "psychic vampire", needing to absorb the psionic energy of others. When he sensed the energies of Cable and [[Nate Grey|X-Man]] nearby, he was delighted at the sheer power they possessed. Exodus battled X-Man, becoming more powerful every time X-Man used his power. It looked as though Exodus would be victorious until X-Man discovered Exodus\' link to Apocalypse. Enraged, X-Man let loose the full extent of his power, which proved to be too much for Exodus to absorb. X-Man then buried Exodus alive by telekinetically tearing open and then slamming shut a huge chasm in an entire mountain.<ref name=XMan14/>\n\n===Back with the Acolytes===\nExodus survived, his powers reverted to normal, and he returned to leading the Acolytes. A weakened [[High Evolutionary]] had given shelter to Luna, and Exodus resolved to kill her and the High Evolutionary as non-mutant "human abominations." Exodus sent an army of Mutates and a team of Acolytes in an attack against the Evolutionary\'s base, [[Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain]]. Despite opposition from Quicksilver and the Knights of Wundagore, Exodus successfully gained control of the citadel while Luna and the High Evolutionary escaped. Exodus considered it his "holy mission" to rid the world of impure and artificial mutants such as the High Evolutionary and his creations, the beings known as [[Inhumans]], and those infected with the [[Legacy Virus]]. He sent a team which included [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Omega Red]], and [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] to find the High Evolutionary, promising the infected members a cure to the Legacy Virus. He also sent Fabian Cortez on a mission to destroy the [[Terrigen Mist]]s in the Inhuman city of [[Attilan]]; however in the end, Cortez failed.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe High Evolutionary decided it was time to regain control of Mount Wundagore, and set off with a team towards the citadel. There he was betrayed by [[Man Beast]] who stole the scepter housing Isotope E, greatly empowering him. Exodus and his Acolytes appeared and Exodus demanded the isotope be handed over. Man Beast refused to comply. After a horrific battle between Exodus and Man Beast, the two came to the conclusion that they had much in common and decided to share the isotope. Together they took Quicksilver, the Knights of Wundagore, and the [[Heroes for Hire]] prisoner. Quicksilver eventually escaped, gained control of Isotope E himself, turned the isotope on himself, and became more powerful than he had ever been before. Exodus apparently proved no match for the super-charged Quicksilver and was soundly defeated.<ref>\'\'Quicksilver\'\' #12</ref>\n\nJust as Pietro began to celebrate however, the High Evolutionary\'s power swang toward the other extreme at the expense of his sanity. The Evolutionary announced his plan to evolve the Earth above and beyond the suffering of ordinary life. The Acolytes refused to help in the battle against High Evolutionary, prompting Exodus to call them cowards; the mutant announced that the High Evolutionary was an abomination and that Exodus would defeat him by any means necessary. [[Thena]] and Exodus\' subsequently proved ineffective, until Man Beast appeared and suggested that the three of them unite their psionic power, as his intimate knowledge of the Evolutionary might allow them to hurt him in an unguarded moment. Quicksilver reasoned with the Evolutionary, who agreed to reconsider his objectives, but at this moment the combined psionic attack of Exodus, Thena, and the Man Beast struck him down. Exodus then incapacitated Thena, hoping to deal the final blow to the Evolutionary himself.<ref>\'\'Quicksilver\'\' #13</ref>\n\nWith the High Evolutionary depowered, Quicksilver reverted to normal, and Thena incapacitated, Exodus attempted once more to destroy the High Evolutionary. However, he was again halted in his attempt, this time by the voice of the Black Knight. The Knight allowed Exodus into his mind where the mutant discovered that this Black Knight was his friend from centuries ago. The two then engaged in combat until the Black Knight defeated Exodus and once again sealed him in the crypt Apocalypse had created.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\nLater on, Exodus escaped from his prison yet again, this time emerging as a changed man. Disguising himself as Magneto, Exodus used his psionic power (boosted by technological means) to bring peace to the island nation of Genosha, forcing humans and mutants to coexist. When he was eventually unmasked by the X-Men, Exodus proclaimed himself a penitent trying desperately to atone for his bigoted past. Without his control, however, Genosha descended into civil war once more, leaving Exodus emotionally devastated.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' 1999 Annual</ref>\n\n===Brotherhood of Mutants===\nThis experience apparently leads him to renew his conviction that mutants were superior and that they were intended to inherit the earth. Having formed a new Brotherhood consisting of [[Avalanche (comics)|Avalanche]], [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Mammomax]], and [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]], Exodus leads an attack on a group of humans but was thwarted by the X-Men. After escaping, this new Brotherhood decided to attack the X-Men in their home. Two of the residents, a young mutant child and a cafeteria employee, die as a result. For the Brotherhood the attack proves a complete disaster, resulting in most of the Brotherhood, Exodus included, being sucked into the mutant [[Xorn]]\'s head. They reappear in Mojoworld and make a deal with [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] to leave. It is unknown whether this deal will come up later.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\n===After M-Day===\nExodus was one of the few mutants who retained his powers after the events of the [[House of M]] storyline. In the \'198 Files\', he is listed as a severe danger. He now leads a new team of [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] with [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], [[Random (comics)|Random]], and [[Tempo (comics)|Tempo]] as followers. Exodus and his new Acolytes attack the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] that is above the Xavier Institute. Their intent is to capture and use [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] to reveal how many mutant births would occur in the future. During the attack, he is opposed by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]\'s team as well as the deprogrammed [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]]. Upon discovering the revelation that no more mutant births occur post-[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] and that he, his Acolytes, the X-Men, and the remaining mutants worldwide are now an endangered species, he leaves. In Antarctica, he bows to [[Mister Sinister]], who reveals that he has a plan to save mutantkind from extinction.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 3 Annual #1</ref>\n\n===Marauders===\nAfter defeating the Hecatomb on Providence, the X-Men return to [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]\'s home where they are betrayed by Mystique, [[Lady Mastermind]], and a possessed [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]] and attacked by the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. This is seemingly part of a three pronged plan, alongside [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] in Providence who attack [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and Exodus with his new group of [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] who ambush the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] while only [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], and the [[New X-Men (2004 series)|New X-Men]] are home. It is apparent that Exodus has allied with the Marauders as part of [[Mister Sinister]]\'s plan to save the mutant race from extinction, leading to, \'[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]\'.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\n===X-Men: Messiah Complex===\n[[Emma Frost]] was able to stalemate Exodus in [[Muir Island]]. He was incapacitated and severely injured by [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] when she emerges from inside of him,<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #207</ref> using her sand form to tear his innards severely.\n\n===X-Men: Legacy===\nIt is revealed that Professor Xavier is in the care of the Acolytes after being shot by [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]].<ref name="XML#208">\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #208</ref> Exodus has apparently fully recovered from Dust\'s attack and is trying to treat the head wound inflicted on the Professor by Bishop. Despite being in a weakened state, Xavier is resisting Exodus\' efforts which requires rebuilding Xavier\'s damaged brain atom by atom but only if all of Xavier\'s memories are temporarily removed. Exodus eventually succeeds despite Xavier\'s resistance, but matters become complicated when Xavier\'s mind refuses to accept the memories back.\n\nExodus is then forced to seek out the aid of the one person who may be able to restore Xavier\'s mind: Magneto. Magneto, with help from [[Karima Shapandar]], manages to restore some of Xavier\'s memories. Later, Magneto is attacked by Exodus, who wishes to punish him for an earlier assault on the Acolyte known as Frenzy. Exodus asks him what punishment he would have instilled on a human who injured a mutant (as the Acolytes now consider him to now be a human and even claim that Magneto is dead and that Lehnsherr is just the human shell that was left over). Magneto states that he would kill a human who harmed a mutant, and Exodus proceeds to choke him telekinetically before Xavier challenges Exodus on the astral plane.\n\nAs Exodus and Xavier duel telepathically, Exodus forces Xavier to face his greatest failures: [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]], his relationship with Cyclops, the devastation of Genosha by [[Cassandra Nova]], and the deaths of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]], and [[Stepford Cuckoos|Sophie Cuckoo]], among others. As Xavier is about to succumb to Exodus, Xavier pulls himself together and proclaims that he has had enough, seemingly throwing back Exodus\' attack with a fierce psionic assault.\n\nAfter the battle, the victorious Xavier threatens to shut off Exodus\' powers permanently if Exodus attacks again. Exodus extends an offer to Xavier to lead the Acolytes but Xavier refuses, calling Exodus a fool for making such an offer, given how much pain and suffering has befallen those who have been entrusted to Xavier\'s care in the past. Xavier later returns to New Avalon and convinces Exodus to disband the Acolytes and find a new way to help mutantkind. Exodus renounces the name Magneto gave him and decides to embark on a personal pilgrimage in order to do this, while some of the former Acolytes--[[Amelia Voght]], [[Random (comics)|Random]] and [[Karima Shapandar]] make the decision to relocate to San Francisco.<ref name="XML#225">\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #225</ref>\n\n===ReGenesis===\nExodus re-appears at the newly established Jean Grey School for Higher Leaning, having heard of the events in Schism that split the X-Men apart. Confronting Wolverine, Rogue, Rachel Grey, Gambit and his former Acolyte, Frenzy, he tells them that their decision to break from Utopia is unacceptable and that he intends to "re-unify" them. After a short, but intense battle, Wolverine tells Exodus to look into their minds so he can understand exactly why they choose to leave Utopia. Exodus is shocked at what he discovers and becomes particularly concerned at Cyclops\' decision to risk Hope\'s life in combat. He apologizes to the group, telling them that they were completely justified in their decision to leave and then departs for Utopia, intending to confront Cyclops personally.<ref name="X-Men Legacy #261" /> Realizing what they have done, Wolverine and his team rushed off to stop him. They engaged him in battle but Rogue realized that they were not strong enough to defeat him by themselves, and sent a distress call to Utopia - hoping that Cyclops\'s Extinction Team would aid them - despite Wolverine\'s objections. The extinction team was otherwise occupied however, and the call was answered by Hope Summers and her team. Together the two teams managed to incapacitate Exodus after his powers are twice weakened by Rogue and copied by Hope. He is taken to Utopia and jailed, but not before he reminded them that it is only a matter of time before the remaining mutants are back under one roof.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #263</ref>\n\nOnce Danger released all the prisoners on Utopia,<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #20</ref> Exodus presumably went free. He reappeared some time later under SHIELD\'s employment when they needed a psychic to deal with an omega-level mutant. However, psionic contact with the mutant instantly killed him.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' vol. 3 #25</ref> This death is eventually undone when Cyclops\' former student, Tempus, went back in time to prevent the omega-level mutant from being born.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' vol. 3 #31</ref>\n\n===All-New, All-Different===\nIn light of the M-Pox crisis, Exodus took over the operations of Someday Enterprises, a shady organization that promised to protect mutants by placing them in stasis but had been weaponizing them instead. Exodus intended to use Someday\'s Sleepers to attack an anti-mutant rally in Washington, D.C. to stoke the fires of fear towards mutants.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' vol. 4 #13</ref>\n\nHe was confronted by Magneto and his team of X-Men who were trying to free the mutants under his control, and Exodus claimed he had been trying to build Magneto an army to consolidate mutant power in the wake of the Terrigen threat through terrorism. Magneto defeated him and had him sealed up in [[Xorn|Xorn\'s]] temple to be used as a fail-safe in case the threat towards mutants reached its peak.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' vol. 4 #14</ref> Exodus was later awakened off-panel and befriended the young mutant [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]], with both mutants coming to Magneto\'s rescue shortly after he suffered a fatal injury in battle with [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]]. After extending a halfhearted offer to Magneto to come with them, Exodus teleported himself and Elixir away to parts unknown.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' vol. 4 #19</ref>\n\nSometime later, Exodus and Elixir were approached by Magneto, who sought their help in containing the Mothervine virus, an aggressive and unstable bioweapon released worldwide by a villainous consortium led by [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] and Havok. With his teleportation powers, Exodus rapidly transported himself, Elixir, and Magneto around the world, allowing Elixir to use his own mutant powers to neutralize the virus in each impact zone. Afterward he transported the trio to the masterminds\' base, where Elixir neutralized the remaining Mothervine samples and put an end to its threat once and for all.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Blue\'\' #28</ref>\n\nDuring a trip taken by Magneto into the future, Exodus was shown to be a member of a new Brotherhood along with Magneto, [[Blob (comics)|the Blob]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], Sabretooth, [[Toad (Marvel Comics)|Toad]], and [[Unuscione]]. This Brotherhood is said to have combated the [[Reavers (comics)|Reaver]] virus (a mysterious new bioweapon that seemingly transforms victims into cyborgs against their will) after the Avengers and the X-Men both proved incapable of stopping the spread of the infection. Although this Brotherhood\'s efforts were not completely successful, they are credited with mutantkind\'s survival and the mutants of the future regard them as saviors.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Blue\'\' #33</ref>\n\n=== House of X ===\nDuring the end of the "House of X" mini-series, all mutants are welcome in Krakoa, even the ones who\'ve had past confrontations with others. Exodus is one of them, he arrives with the likes of Apocalypse, Mr. Sinister, Callisto, Gorgon, Daken, and other "questionable" characters. Charles Xavier is offering Exodus a place as long as he submits to the laws of Krakoa, serving a purpose higher than want or need. \nWhile negotiations and pacts with different world powers and institutions still remain to be cleared, Krakoa has already declared itself as an independent nation. In doing so, its most prominent figures have been elected as part of The [[Quiet Council of Krakoa]], a court of 14 seats. The council is divided into four groups composed of 3 members each and a fourth made up by two members. Exodus has agreed to be a part of the "Winter" Chapter along with Mystique and Mr. Sinister.\n\nDuring the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Exodus is among the psychic mutants that are summoned to Genosha.<ref>\'\'Empyre: X-Men\'\' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He is among those who witness Magik\'s fight with the Cotatinaught.<ref>\'\'Empyre: X-Men\'\' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nExodus is an \'\'\'Omega-level Mutant\'\'\'<ref>{{Cite book|title=House of X|last=Hickman|first=Jonathan|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2019|issue=1}}</ref> and one of the most powerful mutants on earth. He possesses vast superhuman powers, including telepathy, telekinesis, and teleportation, as well as superhuman durability and healing. His high power levels may be a result of tampering by Apocalypse.\n\nHis telepathic abilities have at times matched those of [[Professor X]], [[Emma Frost]] and [[Rachel Grey]] and less than [[Nate Grey|X-Man]] and [[Jean Grey]]. Exodus has also used [[mind control]] to command a dozen X-Men to immediately fall asleep.<ref name="XM2nd#202">\'\'X-Men\'\' #202</ref>\n\nExodus is able to use his telekinetic abilities to lift heavy objects, generate highly durable force fields around him, project damaging blasts and disassemble and reassemble complex technological devices. The [[Hulk]] and Apocalypse have been able to withstand his telekinetic attacks. He also uses this ability to allow himself and fellow Acolytes to affect a form of flight.<ref name="XM2nd#202"/> His telekinesis has sufficient fine control that he could perfectly reform Charles Xavier after Xavier\'s brain and skull were obliterated.\n\nExodus is a teleporter of great range.<ref name="X-Men Legacy #261">\'\'X-Men Legacy\'\' #261</ref><ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #25</ref> He has used this ability to transport himself and others across the planet and regularly transported Acolytes between Earth and the orbiting space station [[Providence (comics)#Avalon: Magneto\'s Acolytes\' space station|Avalon]].\n\nExodus exhibits superhuman durability and taken multiple blows and cuts which would shred an ordinary human including blows from Cannonball and Rogue (using Kid Gladiator\'s strength), gunfire from Hope, detonation from Gambit, and stabbing from Wolverine\'s claws.\n\nExodus has also stated that he can heal and also bring the dead back to life. He appears to have done so on several occasions bringing back Acolytes who had been killed as well as [[Professor X]].<ref name="XML#208"/>\n\nExodus quickly healed himself after [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] entered his mouth in sand form and obliterated his organs. He was on his feet and gathering Xavier\'s destroyed brains telekinetically and teleporting his team off of Muir Island only minutes after losing his internal organs.<ref>\'\'Messiah Complex\'\', chapter 12</ref>\n\nExodus is either immortal or extremely long-lived.\n\nOnce, when severely weakened, he acted as a "psionic vampire", absorbing and stealing psionic energy from those around him and using it to his own advantage to re-energize himself.<ref name=XMan14>\'\'X-Man\'\' #14</ref>\n\nIn the presence of the loyal Acolytes his powers have appeared to be greatly amplified.<ref name="M#3">\'\'[[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]\'\' #3</ref> He showed himself capable of simultaneously:<ref name="Avengers #369"/>\n* Amplifying Genoshan mutates\' hatred of humans\n* Crushing Genosha via a massive force field\n* Immobilizing Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and Jean Grey in another force field\n* Mentally resisting Professor X\'s telepathic control\n* Protecting himself from physical attacks\n* Dealing out powerful psionic damage to both the X-Men and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\n\nExodus has also been shown able to counter at least one form of reality manipulation<ref name="XN2009#6">\'\'X-Nation 2099\'\' #6</ref> and his powers are proved too great to be absorbed by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in their entirety, which led her to pick just one.<ref name="X-Men Legacy #261"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===2099===\nIn the [[Marvel 2099]] universe, Exodus appeared in \'\'[[X-Nation 2099]]\'\'. He was able to defeat [[X-Nation 2099|X-Nation]] and the Wild Boys solo and resist the magic of Mademoiselle Strange and even the reality warping powers of [[Twilight (Marvel Comics)|Twilight]].<ref name="XN2009#6"/> He became the leader of one of the factions searching for the "Mutant Messiah". His search was hampered by worldwide flooding.{{Issue|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Exodus was removed from his stasis by Apocalypse and was tortured by [[Jamie Madrox#Age of Apocalypse|The Madri]]. Exodus was rescued by [[Alternative versions of Magneto#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]] and became a member of the X-Men. Like his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, this Exodus was one of Magneto\'s most powerful followers, though lacking the cruelty of his mainstream counterpart (something that may have been linked to his romantic involvement with the AoA version of [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]]). Exodus was not aware of all his powers as Magneto never told him, afraid that his full power might corrupt him. Necessity forced Magneto to tell Exodus about his powers of teleportation.<ref>\'\'Amazing X-Men\'\' #1</ref>\n\n===House Of M===\nIn this alternate reality, Exodus rules Australia, assisted by [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] and the [[Vanisher]]. They see the humans as nothing more than servants. This attitude brings them trouble when they harass some of the Hulk\'s newfound friends. The Hulk ends up attacking the seat of power directly, knocking Exodus down, seemingly claiming rulership over all Australia. Having been abandoned by Magneto for bringing the trouble on himself by disobeying Magneto\'s orders, Exodus attempts to keep control but quickly loses it. Later, Magneto contacts Banner and attempts to convince him that Exodus was willing to take over again and leave the Aborigines alone.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' vol. 3 #83–85</ref>\n\n===X-Men \'92===\nExodus appears in both volumes of \'\'[[X-Men \'92]]\'\' as one of the Four [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (comics)|Horsemen of Apocalypse]]. Curiously, he is referred to by Apocalypse as [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] in one panel, in what was apparently an editorial mix-up (Bastion is another of Apocalypse\'s Horsemen in this reality).<ref>\'\'X-Men \'92\'\' vol. 2 #10</ref> A new villain was also introduced in the second title, the very-similarly named \'\'\'X-odus the Forgotten [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]\'\'\'. X-odus\' plans to destroy the Earth unite the villainous mutants and humankind with the X-Men.<ref>\'\'X-Men \'92\'\' vol. 2 #8-10</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Video games===\n* Exodus appears as a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] in the videogames \'\'[[X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse]]\'\', \'\'[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]\'\', and \'\'[[X-Men: Gamesmaster\'s Legacy]]\'\'.\n* He makes cameo appearances in every character\'s ending in \'\'[[X-Men: Children of the Atom (video game)|X-Men: Children of the Atom]]\'\', coming to Magneto\'s aid after his defeat and apparently perishing with his master in Avalon\'s destruction.\n* He also makes a cameo appearance in Magneto\'s \'\'[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds|Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]\'\' ending, appearing as one of the many mutants flying freely in the new mutant sanctuary Magneto has transformed Galactus\'s space ship into.\n\n===Novels===\n* Exodus appears in all three books of the \'\'Mutant Empire\'\' trilogy written by [[Christopher Golden]]. As in the comics, he is Magneto\'s faithful lieutenant and guardian of the space station Avalon. Despite his great power, Magneto does not call on Exodus for aid in his plan to occupy New York City and transform it into a sanctuary city for mutants, leading to his eventual defeat at the hands of the X-Men.\n\n===Other appearances===\n* An [[action figure]] of Exodus was produced by [[Toy Biz]] as part of the merged X-Men/X-Force line. He was packaged with a removable cape, wings and a plasma ball accessory.\n* Exodus is a playing piece in the Heroclix game system. He has the \'\'\'Acolytes\'\'\', \'\'\'Brotherhood of Mutants\'\'\', \'\'\'Marauders\'\'\', \'\'Past\'\', and \'\'Warrior\'\' keywords, and is played at 191pts.<ref>HCRealms</ref><ref>Wizkids / NECA</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/e/exodus Marvel Directory]\n*[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Exodus Marvel Universe entry]\n*[http://en.marveldatabase.com/Bennet_du_Paris_%28Earth-616%29 Marvel Database entry]\n{{X-Men characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Exodus (comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Joe Quesada]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with healing abilities]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who have mental powers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telekinetics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics vampires]]'}]}}}}
