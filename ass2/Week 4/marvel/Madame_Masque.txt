As a young adult, Whitney was a debutante and socialite, and became engaged to politician Roger Vane. Following the Frosts\' deaths, Count Nefaria approached Whitney and revealed her true parentage, as he wishes for her to inherit his position as head of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], a [[American Mafia|Mafia]]-like organization based on the [[East Coast of the United States]]. Whitney at first refused, but when she tells Roger about her father, Roger ends their relationship out of fear that her connections to a known criminal would hamper his political prospects. Heartbroken, Whitney accepted her father\'s offer to join the Maggia and was trained by the Count in strategy, criminal activities, and combat. She turned out to be a brilliant student and when her father is imprisoned, she becomes the new "Big M", the leader of the Nefaria family of the Maggia. Her role as Big M brought her into conflict with [[Iron Man]], an old enemy of Count Nefaria.<ref>\'\'[[Tales of Suspense]]\'\' #98. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhitney was forced to flee after a raid on [[Stark Industries]]. The plane she escaped in crashed and Whitney\'s face was badly scarred, but she was saved by the criminal [[Midas (comics)|Mordecai Midas]] and started to work for him. Midas is obsessed with gold and gave Whitney a golden mask to conceal her disfigured face. She also starts using the alias of "Madame Masque."<ref>\'\'[[Iron Man (comic book)|Iron Man]]\'\' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMadame Masque meets Tony Stark (Iron Man\'s [[alter ego]]) and the latter shows concern for her despite her scarred face. She turns on Midas to save Stark, but leaves him because of her criminal past. Unable to forget her feelings, she assumes the identity of Krissy Longfellow, Stark\'s personal secretary. Both come to know each other\'s true identity and start a romantic relationship. Their happiness is short-lived as Count Nefaria is dying due to a failed attempt to gain superhuman powers. Whitney hires the [[Ani-Men]] to bring her father to her and then asks Stark to find a cure for her father. Count Nefaria threatens Stark, and he is forced to fight the Ani-Men as Iron Man. Whitney is unable to choose between her father and her lover, and when Nefaria\'s life-support system is damaged in the fight, she goes insane with guilt and grief.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #116-117.

Masque tries to convince her the Avengers are benevolent and that she should reach out to Stark again, but Whitney is still too fearful to do so. She continues to be a criminal figure of importance, until her father returns from the dead, now with superhuman abilities, and destroys her base. She reluctantly assists the Avengers and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] against the Count, but she secretly plans to betray and destroy both sides, her increased paranoia causing her to believe that she can trust no one but herself, despite moments of doubt such as when Stark unmasks in her presence but lowers his face-plate back when preparing to talk to the rest of the Avengers.{{issue|date=December 2015}} Masque again tries unsuccessfully to convince her to side with the heroes, then joins the battle in Whitney\'s place. Masque obtains a weapon designed to disrupt Nefaria\'s powers that Whitney had prepared for her father, but is slain by Nefaria before she can use it. Madame Masque is shocked by her duplicate\'s nobility and sacrifice, with Iron Man\'s dismayed reaction at what appears to be her death compared to Nefaria\'s glee forcing her to recognize that Masque was right about the Avengers. Whitney joins the battle and plays a key role in her father\'s defeat, her weapon causing him to begin leaking ionic energy until he finally collapses. She renounces her criminal past, and [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-II]] of the Thunderbolts offers her membership, but she declines, departing to parts unknown to consider her future.
