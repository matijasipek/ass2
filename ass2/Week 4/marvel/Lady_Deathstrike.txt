Writers [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Chris Claremont]] added defining characteristics such as her cyborg abilities, while artist [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] designed her [[cyborg]] appearance.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:Deathstrikelady.png|thumb|left|225px|Yuriko\'s second costume]]\nYuriko Oyama (大山 ゆりこ \'\'Oyama Yuriko\'\') was born in [[Osaka, Japan]]. Her father was [[Lord Dark Wind]] (Kenji Oyama), a [[Japan]]ese crime lord and criminal [[scientist]] who created the process by which [[adamantium]] can be bonded to bone. Kenji was a former Japanese [[kamikaze]] pilot during [[World War II]]. His face was horribly scarred in a failed suicide attack on an American battleship. Feeling ashamed by his failure decades earlier, he scarred the faces of Yuriko and her two brothers in a ritual design. Her two brothers later died while in their father\'s service.\n\nYuriko teamed up with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] to free her lover, Kiro, from her father\'s servitude, and to take vengeance on her father for her scarring and the death of her two brothers. She guided Daredevil to Lord Dark Wind\'s private island in search of [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #197-199</ref> However, when Yuriko slew Lord Dark Wind, the devoted Kiro chose [[suicide]] to honor his master.<ref name="AF34"/>\n\nDistraught, Yuriko belatedly embraced her father\'s ideals and sought to track down whoever dishonored him and restore Japan\'s honor. She adopted a costumed identity, as a samurai warrior. She attempted to find Bullseye with an adamantium tracking device, intending to get revenge on him for betraying her father and retrieve the adamantium in his bones for study. Instead, the device led to [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], whose skeleton had also been bonded with adamantium. Deathstrike sought to kill him to right the wrong of the theft of her father\'s theories and to restore her family\'s honor; however, she and her followers were defeated by Wolverine and [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]] of [[Alpha Flight]].<ref>\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' #33-34</ref> She then went to the [[Mojo (comics)|Mojoverse]] and sought [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]]\'s "body shoppe" where she received extensive cybernetic enhancements including adamantium bones and talons. As a cyborg, she became a professional criminal, and joined forces with former [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] mercenaries-turned-cyborgs Cole, Macon, and Reese. The four cyborgs stalked Wolverine and [[Katie Power]] in New York.<ref name="cyborgde"/>\n\nLady Deathstrike &mdash; along with Cole, Macon, and Reese &mdash; joined the team of criminal cyborgs called the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], led by [[Donald Pierce]]. Together, the Reavers captured and crucified Wolverine.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #251</ref> Lady Deathstrike was accidentally teleported along with Wolverine and [[Puck (comics)|Puck]] to 1937 Spain. There, she joined forces with a Luftwaffe unit, and battled Wolverine. Her right arm was destroyed by a tank, and when she returned to the present she was given a new right arm.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 2 #35-38</ref> The Reavers gang was broken up by [[Trevor Fitzroy]]\'s [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] and most of them were destroyed, though Deathstrike herself survived.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #281</ref> She later battled Wolverine and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] in Times Square.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 2 #45-46</ref>\n\nAt times she has resigned her quest to kill Logan and has even worked with the X-Men cooperatively toward a common goal,<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' Annual 2000</ref> such as the defeat of [[Stryfe]].{{issue|date=April 2013}} In an encounter with Logan shortly after [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] removed the adamantium from his skeleton, Lady Deathstrike again encounters Puck and Vindicator. The fight with Wolverine destroys much of Vindicator\'s house and ends when Wolverine reveals his bone claws. As Logan no longer possessed the adamantium stolen from her father, she concluded there was no honor to be gained by killing him. She leaves the premises peacefully.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 2 #77-78</ref> However, she still remains a [[mercenary]] and an [[assassination|assassin]]. Despite all this, Yuriko is set apart from many of the X-Men\'s foes in that she adheres to an [[Ethical code|honor code]], despite being emotionally disturbed.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nWhen [[Captain America]] unexpectedly appears in Japan after a year spent in another dimension, he manages to find Lady Deathstrike working with terrorists. Their goals were to drive American influence out of Japan, by any means possible, including mass murder. Captain America defeats her before any innocent lives are lost.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nLady Deathstrike resurfaced as an ally of [[William Stryker]].<ref>\'\'God Loves, Man Kills II\'\'</ref> She displays a new ability to access the Internet via her cybernetics but this led to her being co-opted and controlled by Mount Haven\'s computer systems.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nLady Deathstrike was responsible for mutilating and nearly killing [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], whose legs she severed in battle.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}\n\nFollowing her confrontation with Rogue and Sunfire, Lady Deathstrike resurfaced as a member of one of the United States government\'s Army of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in the super hero [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]], temporarily released from prison in order to go after the Secret Avengers, who resisted the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]]. She fights alongside other criminals such as [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]], [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Jack O\'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O\'Lantern]], [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]].<ref>\'\'Civil War\'\' #5</ref> She participates in the final battle of the Civil War in [[Times Square]], [[New York City]], before being sent to the Negative Zone Prison.<ref>\'\'Civil War\'\' #7</ref>\n\nLady Deathstrike returns during the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]] story to play an important role in the series, facing off against [[X-23]].<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/820/820663p6.html IGN: Marvel in December 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This was confirmed by IGN Comics, who, in their editorial analysis "13 Days of Messiah Complex," revealed that Deathstrike would be leading a new team of [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]] throughout the event.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/articles/827/827571p7.html IGN: X-Men: Messiah Complex - Day Thirteen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As reported, Lady Deathstrike appears alongside the Reavers, now made up of nameless Purifiers with armor and weapons instead of any former members.<ref>\'\'New X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #44</ref> Having allied with the Purifiers to destroy mutant-kind, Lady Deathstrike leads the new Reaver team against the [[New X-Men (2004 series)|New X-Men]], gravely wounding [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] in the process. Her armor was destroyed by X-23 and [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]]. She appears again in pursuit of Cable and the mutant newborn<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 3 #26</ref><ref>\'\'New X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #45</ref> where she battled [[X-Force]] and [[X-23]] again and X-23 nearly kills her.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nLady Deathstrike is apparently saved from death due to the actions of [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], as she is later seen under repair in Spiral\'s Body Shoppe when [[Madelyne Pryor]] approaches Spiral with an invitation of membership in her [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Lady Deathstrike\'s Sisterhood|Sisterhood of Mutants]]. Despite not originally being approached to join the Sisterhood, Lady Deathstrike accepts Pryor\'s offer nonetheless.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #504</ref> It appears that while Spiral repaired Lady Deathstrike\'s body, she also gave her a more submissive personality, as during missions with the Sisterhood, she continually does whatever she is told, while referring to Spiral as "Mistress".<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #508</ref> After the Sisterhood resurrects [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]], they finally make their move on the X-Men, with Lady Deathstrike being tasked to take down Wolverine, by piercing his lungs.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #509</ref> Lady Deathstrike kept Wolverine busy while the Sisterhood raided his room for one of his most treasured possessions: a lock of [[Jean Grey]]\'s hair.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #510</ref>\n\nLady Deathstrike later reappeared with the Reavers. Still driven for revenge against Wolverine, Lady Deathstrike worked with the Reavers to suicide-bomb Utopia. However, when [[X-Force]] intervened, Lady Deathstrike escaped her body via Internet.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' #5.1</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]\'\' storyline, Lady Deathstrike was seen in one of [[Doctor Octopus]]\'s facilities in Australia. When [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II enters this facility, Lady Deathstrike ambushes and kills him in one swift swipe from her claw.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth\'\' #1</ref>\n\nLady Deathstrike and the Reavers are later seen in the Core, an underground city populated by robots. She does battle with [[Captain Britain]] after the [[Secret Avengers]] arrive in the city in search of [[Ant-Man (Eric O\'Grady)|Ant-Man]].<ref>\'\'Secret Avengers\'\' #24</ref>\n\nLady Deathstrike\'s consciousness was later uploaded in the body of Ana Cortes, establishing a symbiotic relationship with Ana\'s consciousness. Cortes was a teenage Latin female that has returned to Bogota, Colombia from boarding school after the death of her father to inherit her deceased father\'s kingdom. She then traveled to the Jean Grey Academy alongside her friend Reiko to find [[Karima Shapandar]] and retrieve the Omega Sentinel technology. Deathstrike and her team see her jogging with [[M (Marvel Comics)|Monet]], and attempt to ambush them. During the confrontation, Karmina is shot, and Monet manages to protect her temporarily, until Monet gets caught off guard. Before Deathstrike could finish her attack, Karmina shoots, and injures Lady Deathstrike causing her to retreat to regroup and get more intel. She then learns of Arkea, and has hired [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] to help her achieve this goal.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 4 #7</ref> Deathstrike and Typhoid Mary argue with John Sublime about Arkea and they manage to get information out of him that there was more than one piece of Arkea that was alive, as the one they had was dead and not viable. Mary knocks Sublime unconscious and she and Deathstrike manages to escape before Psylocke comes to check on Sublime. Deathstrike and Mary makes their way to Troms, Norway, where they find [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Amora]], who has been exiled by Thor and stripped of her powers.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 4 #8 (Dec. 18, 2013)</ref> Deathstrike promises Amora that she will make her powerful once again. Amora brings Deathstrike and Mary to where the Arkea meteorite is located when Mary wants to renegotiate the terms of her hire and want to become partners. Deathstrike says it was not just a partnership, but the formation of a new [[Brotherhood of Mutants#Deathstrike\'s Sisterhood|Sisterhood of Mutants]]. With the live Arkea taking possession of Reiko, she empowers Deathstrike, Mary and Amora. Deathstrike and her Sisterhood manage to escape the X-Men and [[M (Marvel Comics)|Monet]] with Arkea activating several sentinels under the ocean.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 4 #9 (Jan. 22, 2014)</ref> The mental conflict between Ana and Yuriko made Lady Deathstrike increasingly unstable. Ana Cortes grew to regret her life as a supervillain and did not like the direction Arkea was leading the Sisterhood. She notified the X-Men of the Sisterhood\'s location, after she became increasingly concerned about Arkea\'s bold moves such as having Amora resurrect Selene Gallio, the Black Queen.<ref name="X-Men Vol 2014">\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 4 #11 (Feb. 2014)</ref> Ana flipped out and tried to get Typhoid Mary to kill her, but Mary refused. Upon Arkea asking Ana to come be a part of the procedure to resurrect Madelyne Pryor, Ana killed herself to prevent Arkea from using her further.<ref name="X-Men Vol 2014"/> Ana\'s death didn\'t stop Arkea\'s plans. Arkea simply removed Yuriko\'s consciousness from Ana\'s body and placed it in Reiko\'s body along with Arkea\'s own. Ana\'s body was spliced with Jean Grey\'s DNA in order to enable it to host Madelyne Pryor\'s consciousness. Amora then completed the resurrection of Madelyne Pryor. After the X-Men\'s confrontation with the Sisterhood, Karima leaves the X-Men to team up with Sabra and investigate the Cortes crime family. Though Arkea was destroyed by the X-Men, Lady Deathstrike\'s consciousness remained intact inside Reiko\'s body.<ref name="X-Men Vol. 4 #12 March 2014">\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 4 #12 (March 2014)</ref>\n\nThe Reavers later arrived in Killhorn Falls with Lady Deathstrike and attempt to hunt down Logan for good.<ref>\'\'Old Man Logan\'\' vol. 2 #5</ref> As the Reavers attacked Killhorn Falls, [[Old Man Logan]] single-handedly killed all the Reavers soldiers and confronted Lady Deathstrike before saving Maureen. After being wounded multiple times, Logan manages to defeat Lady Deathstrike, as she started limping away when Logan blacked out. Thinking that he failed to protect Maureen from the chaos, Logan decided to set-off to find Lady Deathstrike.<ref>\'\'Old Man Logan\'\' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nWhile in hiding during the "Weapons of Mutant Destruction" storyline, Lady Deathstrike is discovered and captured by the new Weapon X. While held in their captivity, she is experimented on.<ref>\'\'Weapon X\'\' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> This experiment led to her nanotechnology being used in their creation of [[Weapon H]].<ref>\'\'The Totally Awesome Hulk\'\' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Lady Deathstrike is seen at Chester\'s Bar where she tells Daken and Sabretooth about what the Reavers discovered when they went after Wolverine and that he has recently been sighted alive. The three of them go on the trail of Wolverine where they arrive in Maybelle, Arizona.<ref>\'\'Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike continue searching Maybelle for Wolverine when they are attacked by zombies made from those at a birthday party. One of them bites Sabretooth as Lady Deathstrike gets him away from the zombies. Both of them wonder where the zombies came from. As they get to their car, it suddenly explodes. Sabretooth starts running and finds that his zombie bite is not healing. Sabretooth comes across more zombies as he starts killing them with Lady Deathstrike not far behind him. Both of them take refuge in a garage.<ref>\'\'Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer\'\' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Daken catches up to them, Lady Deathstrike and Sabretooth are informed of a glowing green device in the power station that has to do with the zombies and they must fight their way past the zombies to destroy it before Maybelle is burned to the ground. While fighting zombies and Soteira Killteam Nine, Lady Deathstrike discovers that one of the soldiers from Soteira Killteam Nine is a zombified version of her father who stabs Lady Deathstrike.<ref>\'\'Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer\'\' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lady Deathstrike recovers and continues her fight with her father until Lord Dark Wind cuts off her left hand. Using her right hand, Lady Deathstrike stabs her father in the neck. Then she does the same thing to a zombified [[Graydon Creed]]. After telling Sabretooth that the adamantium they tracked was her father\'s adamantium and learning that Daken is dead, Lady Deathstrike accompanies Sabretooth to where the glowing device is and destroy the device before Maybelle can be burned to the ground. The next day, Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike carjack someone outside a diner as Sabretooth suggests to Lady Deathstrike to have her Reaver friends get her a new hand. Lady Deathstrike tells Sabretooth to shut up and drive.<ref>\'\'Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer\'\' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLady Deathstrike was transformed into a [[cyborg]] by [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and the "Body Shop" using alien technology of [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]]\'s dimension,<ref name="cyborgde">\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #205</ref> with later modifications by [[Donald Pierce]].{{issue|date=December 2012}} She has [[superhuman]] strength, speed, stamina, durability, and agility. Deathstrike\'s skeleton has been artificially laced with molecules of adamantium, rendering her skeletal structure physically unbreakable. Later, in the pages of \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\', it was shown that Spiral used magic to infuse the metal into Deathstrike\'s body.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Deathstrike\'s fingers have been replaced by five {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} long adamantium claws replacing each finger of each hand. Aside from being as indestructible as her skeleton, these talons are capable of slicing through virtually any substance, other than adamantium itself and [[Captain America\'s shield]]. She is capable of telescoping these claws to twice their usual length. She also had the ability to interface with computers, allowing direct data access to her brain\'s memory centers. Although her normal form is visibly that of a cyborg, she uses disguises when necessary. She is a trained [[assassination|assassin]] and is skilled in a variety of Asian martial arts. Lady Deathstrike is especially skilled with swords, and while she prefers stealth and subtlety in her killings, she is emotionally disturbed and this interferes with her effectiveness. Deathstrike suffers from mental instability; she is an unbalanced fanatic, a condition worsened by her transformation into a cyborg.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nBefore she received her cybernetic enhancements, Deathstrike used a special five-foot steel katana that was electromagnetically tempered and sheathed in energy.<ref name="AF34">\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' #34</ref>  The energy sheath enabled the sword to cut through most substances and made it as resilient as adamantium. She has also used shuriken, nunchakus, a high-powered long-range blaster which fires armor-piercing explosive bullets, and wrist-bands containing adamantium detectors. She also wore a modified traditional Japanese battle-armor which could withstand even superhuman blows.<ref name="AF34"/> Her items were constructed by weapon-smiths of Lord Dark Wind\'s organization.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nDeathstrike later received an upgrade that provides her with a kind of "cybernetic healing factor" that functions similarly, although not as efficiently, to Wolverine\'s.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 2 #114</ref>\n\nLady Deathstrike is fluent in both English and Japanese, and an accomplished pilot of various air and sea-craft.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe left side of Yuriko Oyama\'s face was scarred in a ritual design by her father; this was apparently surgically repaired when she became a cyborg.<ref name="cyborgde"/>\n\nLady Deathstrike\'s original body was destroyed.

There, her connection lies mainly with [[Alternative versions of Storm#Ultimate Marvel|Storm]], instead of Wolverine as in the original storyline. As Yuriko (or \'Yuri\'), she taught Storm how to [[hotwiring|hotwire]] vehicles and be a car thief. The two later had a falling out, and Yuri ended up being run over by a truck. Yuri survived, but needed to use a wheelchair. There, [[Abraham Cornelius#Ultimate Doctor Cornelius|Dr. Cornelius]] of [[Weapon X#Ultimate Marvel|Weapon X]] offered to have her shattered body rebuilt with adamantium, extendable claws, and an accelerated healing factor based on Wolverine\'s DNA, which would allow her to have her revenge against Storm, though if she wanted to kill Storm she would have to kill Storm\'s friend Wolverine as well. Yuri agreed, and underwent the modifications. She later went after Storm and Wolverine, but was defeated, and later imprisoned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #61</ref>\n\nWhile imprisoned at the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], she encountered the X-Men [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Dazzler]] and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] (who were out searching for their friends, elsewhere in the base). After Dazzler taunted Yuri, saying how Storm had mentioned her to them, the power went out, allowing Yuri to escape her cell and stab Dazzler through the stomach. Before she could do anything else, the mutant [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Longshot]] (another prisoner at the Triskelion) snapped Yuri\'s neck.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #65</ref> Whether or not this attack killed her is unknown.
