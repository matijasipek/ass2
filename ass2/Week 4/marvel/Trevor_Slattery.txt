Slattery stars in propaganda videos that are broadcast to the world as a cover for AIM\'s explosive [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Extremis|Extremis]] experiments. Slattery lives oblivious to the true meaning of his actions, surrounded by wealth and drugs provided by AIM, until he is discovered by [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]. Slattery is arrested following Stark\'s defeat of Killian, but was pleased by the publicity he received as he was arrested.\n\n=== Incarceration ===\n{{Further|All Hail the King}}\nIn Seagate Prison, Slattery lives luxuriously, with his own personal "butler" and adoring fans among the other inmates, until he is broken out by [[Jackson Norriss (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Jackson Norriss]], a [[Ten Rings (organization)|Ten Rings]] terrorist posing as a documentary filmmaker, who explains that the [[Wenwu|real "Mandarin"]] is angered with Slattery\'s use of the title, and wishes to take it back.\n\n=== Helping Shang-Chi ===\n{{Further|Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings}} \nFollowing the events of \'\'All Hail the King\'\', Slattery was sentenced to death by the Ten Rings but Xu Wenwu, the real leader of the Ten Rings, made Slattery his "court [[jester]]" within his compound after Slattery entertained him with his [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] monologues. While imprisoned, Slattery becomes sober and more refined, and befriends a captured [[hundun]] that he names [[Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe#Morris|Morris]]. Some time later after the [[The Blip|Blip]] took place, Slattery escapes the compound with the help of Wenwu\'s children [[Shang-Chi (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Shang-Chi]] and [[Xialing]] as well as Shang-Chi\'s friend [[Katy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Katy]], and travels with them to Morris\' home, [[Ta Lo]]. Slattery helps defend the mystical village from the Ten Rings and later the forces of the [[Dweller-in-Darkness (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Dweller-in-Darkness]]. After the Dweller\'s defeat, Slattery and Morris are present among the Ta Lo warriors at the funeral ceremony for those who were lost in the battle.\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Ben Kingsley by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Kingsley at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nWhile writing the screenplay for \'\'[[Iron Man 3]]\'\', [[Shane Black]] and [[Drew Pearce]] wanted to thematically reflect "the idea for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony <nowiki>[</nowiki>Stark<nowiki>]</nowiki>]] of false faces and the idea of the dual personality of Tony as an out superhero who is basically using his self-definition through the false face of Iron Man." Pearce pitched, "what if the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] is an actor?" to Black, and the character was developed from there.<ref name="PearceSR" /> [[Ben Kingsley]] entered negotiations for the role in April 2012,<ref name="Kingsley" /> and had joined the cast of \'\'Iron Man 3\'\' by September, when he stated, "Quite soon I\'ll be with everybody and we\'ll be discussing the look and the feel and the direction of the character. It\'s very early days yet, but I\'m so thrilled to be on board."<ref name="Kingsley2" />\n\nThe idea for a [[Marvel One-Shot]] centered on Slattery was conceived on the \'\'Iron Man 3\'\' set by Pearce and producer Stephen Broussard.<ref name="AssemblingAUniverse" /> [[Marvel Studios]] and consultant [[Joss Whedon]] were positive about the short, reliant on Kingsley\'s involvement.<ref name="PearceSR" /> In October 2013, Kingsley said he was working on a secret project with Marvel involving "many members of the crew that were involved in \'\'Iron Man 3\'\'."<ref name="KingsleySecret" /> This was later revealed to be the short, written and directed by Pearce.<ref name="KingsleyOS" /> Though some of the dialogue is written in response to critics of \'\'Iron Man 3\'\'{{\'}}s Mandarin portrayal, the story was written simply as an extension of the Ten Rings and Mandarin storyline featured throughout the \'\'Iron Man\'\' films. Pearce wrote the short to be ambiguous enough that the storyline could be further explored in future films or television series.<ref name="PearceSR" />\n\n== Characterization ==\nFor his performance as Slattery as the Mandarin, Kingsley "wanted a voice that would disconcert a Western audience. I wanted a voice that would sound far more homegrown and familiar—a familiarity like a teacher\'s voice or a preacher\'s voice. The rhythms and tones of an earnest, almost benign, teacher—trying to educate people for their own good."<ref name="Kingsley4" /> Black explained that part of altering the character from the comics was to avoid the [[Fu Manchu]] stereotype, and instead say that he "draws a cloak around him of Chinese symbols and dragons because it represents his obsessions with [[Sun Tzu]] in various ancient arts of warfare that he studied." The videos where the Mandarin gives historical background to the "attacks" show how he was created by "a [[think tank]] of people trying to create a modern terrorist",<ref name=comm /> and so "represents every terrorist in a way," from South American [[guerrilla warfare|insurgency tactics]] to the [[Videos and audio recordings of Osama bin Laden|videos of]] [[Osama bin Laden]].<ref name="Yahoo" /> [[Colonel Kurtz]] from \'\'[[Apocalypse Now]]\'\' was also an influence for the Mandarin.<ref name="Yahoo" />\n\n== Reception ==\nThe reveal of Trevor Slattery in \'\'Iron Man 3\'\', after only his terrorist Mandarin persona had been marketed, was met with mixed responses, as many fans of the comics opposed the changes made to the original character.<ref name="FansBI" /> Matt Singer of \'\'[[Business Insider]]\'\' defended the twist, saying, "They are not upset with the movie because it\'s bad—that would be a legitimate complaint—they\'re upset because it\'s good, but not in the same way that the original comic books were good." Singer felt that the film "rather brilliantly evades that minefield [of the comics\' racist caricature] by using it as the fuel for satire; revealing the Kingsley Mandarin\'s mish-mosh of Orientalist imagery as a construction designed to play into ignorant people\'s fears. Black suggests we should be far more worried about the well-dressed, amoral CEO than the vaguely defined "Other" of so many bad pieces of pop culture....Part of what I liked about \'\'Iron Man 3\'\' was the fact that it did something different. Where some readers saw a slap in the face, I saw a refreshing change."<ref name="DefenseCW" />\n\nDevin Faraci at \'\'Birth.Movies.Death.\'\' found the character more "satisfying" than a more faithful version of the character could have been, stating, "the reveal of the truth behind The Mandarin would be worthless if it was handled poorly. Thankfully Black has cast Sir Ben Kingsley in the role, and he demolishes the part. As The Mandarin he\'s a heart of darkness, a stylized amalgamation of four decades\' worth of demagogues and terrorists. As Trevor Slattery ... he\'s a comic dream, a dissolute mess into which Kingsley just hilariously collapses. It\'s a brilliant performance".<ref name="ReviewBMD" /> Joey Esposito, writing for [[IGN]], was "totally shocked" by the fan backlash to the character, feeling that the update was an improvement by avoiding "the traditional portrayal of the character[, that] being the perpetuation of a stereotype that has no place in modern society." Esposito thought that even the film\'s initial depiction of the Mandarin was "ridiculous and silly", and that the Slattery reveal "redeemed" that part of the film for him.<ref name="ReviewIGN" />\n\nIn response to the fan controversy, Pearce said, "I\'m unbelievably proud of what we did, and also the fact that we actually snuck a surprise into a big summer movie, which is, on a logistical level alone, really hard to do, now. I was surprised at the small but vocal group\'s venom about [the character change], but...I could see how that surprise might be a bit of a shock. And I\'m sorry that it pissed people off, but I\'m also like, it\'s kind of our job to push the boundaries and surprise and hopefully delight."<ref name="PearceCBR" /> Black, also responding to the controversy, said, "What was of use about the Mandarin\'s portrayal in this movie, to me, is that it offers up a way that you can sort of show how people are complicit in being frightened ... hopefully, by the end you\'re like, \'Yeah, we were really frightened of the Mandarin, but in the end he really wasn\'t that bad after all.\' In fact, the whole thing was just a product of this anonymous, behind-the-scenes guy" rather than the "available and obvious target", "a message that\'s more interesting for the modern world".<ref name="BlackSR" />\n\nReviewing \'\'All Hail the King\'\', Cliff Wheatley, also at IGN, described the short as "a return to the loveable personality of the hapless Trevor ... that should satisfy both lovers and haters" of the character. He added that "Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans."<ref name="IGNAHTK" /> Faraci felt that the character "was used the perfect amount in \'\'Iron Man Three\'\', and giving him more screen time here, in a side project, feels the right way to return to him. Kingsley is having a blast, delivering plenty of wonderful jokes and sinking right into the clueless, egocentric character who represents all of our worst stereotypes of actors."<ref name="BMDAHTK" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name="PearceSR">{{Cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/iron-man-4-mandarin-runaways-marvel-interview/ |title=Drew Pearce Talks \'All Hail The King\', Runaways, The Real Mandarin & Marvel Future |last=Keyes |first=Rob |date=February 27, 2014 |website=ScreenRant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227225329/http://screenrant.com/iron-man-4-mandarin-runaways-marvel-interview/ |archive-date=February 27, 2014 |access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="KingsleySecret">{{Cite web |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/kingsley-for-secret-marvel-job-29685825.html |title=Kingsley for \'secret\' Marvel job |date=October 22, 2013 |website=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502140224/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/kingsley-for-secret-marvel-job-29685825.html |archive-date=May 2, 2014 |access-date=October 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="AssemblingAUniverse">{{Cite AV media |title=Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe |date=2014 |publisher=ABC Home Entertainment |place=\'\'Marvel\'s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Complete First Season\'\' Home media, bonus material}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="KingsleyOS">{{Cite magazine |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/01/09/marvel-one-shot-ben-kingsley-mandarin-all-hail-the-king/ |title=Marvel One-Shot: First Look at Ben Kingsley\'s Mandarin encore in \'All Hail the King\' short film -- Exclusive |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |date=January 9, 2014 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110023625/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/01/09/marvel-one-shot-ben-kingsley-mandarin-all-hail-the-king/ |archive-date=January 10, 2014 |access-date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="Kingsley">{{Cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ben-kingsley-iron-man-3-robert-downey-jr-jon-favreau-309693 |title=Ben Kingsley in Talks to Join \'Iron Man 3\' |last=Kit |first=Borys |date=April 9, 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=April 10, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025154718/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ben-kingsley-iron-man-3-robert-downey-jr-jon-favreau-309693 |archive-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="Kingsley2">{{Cite web |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/170511-exclusive-sir-ben-kingsleys-character-still-in-qearly-stagesq |title=Exclusive: Sir Ben Kingsley\'s Iron Man 3 Character Still Being Developed |last=Douglas |first=Edward |date=May 6, 2012 |website=Superherohype.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819135816/http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/170511-exclusive-sir-ben-kingsleys-character-still-in-qearly-stagesq |archive-date=August 19, 2012 |access-date=September 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="Kingsley4">{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/ben-kingsley-iron-man-3_n_3177754.html |title=Ben Kingsley, \'Iron Man 3\' Star, On The Challenges of Playing The Mandarin |last=Ryan |first=Mark |date=April 29, 2013 |website=Huffington Post |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209132812/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/29/ben-kingsley-iron-man-3_n_3177754.html |archive-date=December 9, 2013 |access-date=April 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="comm">{{Cite AV media |section=\'\'[[Audio commentary]] for \'\'Iron Man 3 |last=Black, Shane; Pearce, Drew |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment |year=2013 |title=Iron Man 3 |medium=Blu-Ray}}</ref>\n\n<ref name="Yahoo">{{Cite news |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/iron-man-3-mandarin-origins-explained-164713346.html |title=\'Iron Man 3\': The Mandarin\'s origins explained!
