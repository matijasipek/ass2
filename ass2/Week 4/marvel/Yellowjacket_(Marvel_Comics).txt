I knew they were going to meet the [[Masters of Evil]]... She was a member of the Masters of Evil at the time and I liked her. I thought it would be nice to have someone see the 31st Century through present-day eyes. It would give a new perspective, so I asked if I could have her.

However, when she clashed with the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], she became terrified upon shrinking, and was captured.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #264</ref>\n\nYellowjacket participates in a takeover of the Avengers Mansion, assisting one of the more powerful versions of the [[Masters of Evil]] as a professional criminal.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #273-277</ref> Defeated, Yellowjacket is sent to prison but is freed by the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] with amorous intentions. She flees and tries to gain revenge on the Wasp, but is distracted by the sight of [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]. Furious at being rejected, the Fixer tries to kill her. Black Knight helps Yellowjacket defeat him and the two part on possibly romantic terms.<ref>\'\'Solo Avengers\'\' #12</ref>\n\nDuring a time when no Avengers were active, her costume receives a call for help from an automated system at an old Avengers base. She finds herself teaming up with the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Captain America#Captain|The Captain]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Hercules (comics)#Marvel Comics|Hercules]], the [[Hulk]] and [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]]. They battle the [[High Evolutionary]] wishing to jumpstart humanity\'s evolution through worldwide catastrophe. Yellowjacket helps battle through the Evolutionary\'s underground submarine base, fighting against dozens of his soldiers. Eventually the Evolutionary is defeated by Hercules, the two evolving out of reality.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' Annual #17</ref> She later briefly serves as a member of [[Superia]]\'s [[Femizons]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #389-391</ref>\n\nHer second affiliation with the Masters of Evil begins and ends during the [[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]. Her team, led by [[Doctor Octopus]], confronts the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] inside the Avengers Mansion as the Masters had wished to take it over. Yellowjacket is soon betrayed by her side. Moments later, both teams are overwhelmed by waves of evil aliens. These aliens were impersonating all the super-powered beings involved. Each double wishes to take over the relevant body. Despite many aliens being slain, more show up.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe Guardians and the Masters both work together to stay alive. Events in the \'\'Infinity War\'\' series stop the flow of aliens. When Doctor Octopus desires to continue the fight, his men turn on him, not wanting to hurt those who had helped them. Yellowjacket is left behind and joined the Guardians.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\n=====Guardians of the Galaxy=====\nYellowjacket went to the 31st century with Guardians of the Galaxy. She further proves her worth when she saved the life of [[Charlie-27]] by shrinking, flying inside his throat, and performing "surgery" on a massive [[blood clot]] with her stings. She forms a close friendship with [[Nikki (comics)|Nikki]]. She later uses 31st century technology to redesign her costume, making it look less like Henry Pym\'s design (she even found a way to fly without installing wings on her costume).{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\nShe used her powers as a valued member of the team, until, homesick, she attempts to return to the 20th century. On the way, she stops in the near future and learns that a disaster was about to happen to the Avengers in her target time. On her return to the present, she confronts [[Iron Man]] under the control of [[Immortus]], a powerful time-traveling being in the guise of [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Iron Man kills Yellowjacket.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Crossing\'\' #1</ref>\n\n=====Resurrection=====\nDuring the \'\'[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]\'\' storyline, Yellowjacket is among the dead people released by [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] to defend the Underworld from [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>\'\'Chaos War\'\' #2</ref> Because of what happened to the death realms, Yellowjacket is among the dead people that return from the dead.<ref>\'\'Chaos War: Dead Avengers\'\' #1</ref> Yellowjacket joins with the other resurrected Avengers as they fight [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and [[Nekra]].<ref>\'\'Chaos War: Dead Avengers\'\' #2</ref> Yellowjacket, along with the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]], and the [[Shi\'ar]] warrior [[Deathcry]] are given a second chance to live when the three of them survive Grim Reaper\'s attacks.<ref>\'\'Chaos War: Dead Avengers\'\' #3</ref> After the defeat of the Chaos King, resurrected members of [[Alpha Flight]] were seen having been fully restored to life but there has been no sign of Yellowjacket.<ref>\'\'Chaos War\'\' #5</ref>\n\n===Darren Cross===\n{{main|Darren Cross}}\n\'\'\'Darren Cross\'\'\' is the third character to use the Yellowjacket codename, after gaining the costume thanks to [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], and also became a supervillain.<ref>\'\'The Astonishing Ant-Man\'\' #12.
