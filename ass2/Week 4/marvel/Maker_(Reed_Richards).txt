However, due to his bookish and introverted personality, he was regularly picked on and tormented by bullies, while also receiving similar treatment from his father, who despised his son for his non-masculine and studious nature. However, as a result of demonstrating a [[teleportation|teleporter]] at a school science fair, Reed was later recruited for a government think-tank sponsoring intellectually-gifted youngsters and child polymaths, similar to Reed. He conducts his research, along with several other students, at a facility located in the Baxter Building in [[Manhattan]], where he meets [[Human Torch#Ultimate Marvel|Johnny Storm]] and [[Invisible Woman#Ultimate Marvel|Sue Storm]], with whom Reed becomes smitten and romantically involved. During the final experimentation phase of his research, Reed was visited by [[Alternative versions of the Thing#Ultimate Marvel|Ben Grimm]], his best and only friend since childhood, who protected him from bullies during his years in school. At the age of 21, Reed, along with other scientists, attempted to teleport organic material through an alternate [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] called the [[Negative Zone|N-Zone]], with Sue assisting him and Johnny and Ben observing the demonstration. The experiment goes awry, resulting in the four being engulfed in a parallel dimension termed as the "N-Zone" and grants the four with super-powers, with Reed being able to stretch his body parts to incredible lengths and is endowed with enhanced durability. After a series of adventures and encounters with a number of super-human and extraterrestrial threats, during the four\'s attempts to solve the mystery behind the source of their new-found powers and turn Reed and Ben back to normal, the four are later exposed to the media and public, who name the group as: "The Fantastic Four", with Reed undertaking the alias of "Mr. Fantastic" and embarking on numerous adventures and conflicts against inter-dimensional adversaries and super-human enemies. Throughout the series, Ultimate Reed Richards\' personality remains largely similar to his Earth-616 counterpart, being a well-meaning, altruistic and unassuming, but socially-awkward, quirky, eccentric and over-analytical polymath in his early-20s, who balances his love and passion for science with his blossoming relationship with Sue, while also serving as the brains and leader of the Fantastic Four, devising the team\'s equipment and strategy against adversaries, while being notably younger and snarkier than his mainstream counterpart.\n\nAfter the \'\'[[Ultimatum (comics)|Ultimatum]]\'\' miniseries resulted in the death of many heroes, Reed attempts to propose to Sue during Franklin Storm\'s funeral but she breaks up with him and the Fantastic Four is disbanded. Reed is later seen working with aliens to pillage the artifacts stored at [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Project_Pegasus|Project Pegasus]]. It becomes clear that Reed\'s worldview has changed to a more sinister outlook, as a result of the mental and emotional trauma endured from the Ultimatum coupled with Sue\'s rejection and breakup. In \'\'[[Ultimate Enemy]]\'\', he is shown to be living with his parents again before an explosion seemingly kills them.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Enemy\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In \'\'[[Ultimate Mystery]]\'\', Reed is revealed to have orchestrated his family\'s murders and faked his own death, before allying himself with the attacking aliens.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Mystery\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> \'\'[[Ultimate Doomsday]]\'\' sees Reed confronted by his former teammates, as well as [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Spider-Man]], [[Mahr Vehl]], and the [[Ultimates]]. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear to his former friends that Reed is a threat to the world. Part of his motivation to become a villain is that he no longer likes his home dimension and wishes he could find another world to improve.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Doom\'\'. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn \'\'[[Ultimate Fallout]]\'\', Reed is revealed to have survived his defeat and is shown trapped in the [[Negative Zone]]. He soon escapes and returns to his world, where he vows to win back his friends by saving the planet.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fallout\'\' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> In \'\'[[Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates]]\'\', Reed is revealed to be the Maker, creator of The City and leader of the [[Future Foundation|Children of Tomorrow]], a race of genetically engineered superhumans. He has come back to fight against the Ultimates after spending 1,000 years in the distant future - having been unable to age due to his powers - and the top of his head has been \'stretched\' in order to increase his intelligence. It is not until Reed reveals his face to [[Thor (Ultimate Marvel character)|Thor]] that the Ultimates learn his true identity.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jonathan Hickman]] | Penciller = [[Esad Ribic]] and [[Brandon Peterson]] | Colorist = [[John Rauch]] | Title = Ultimate Comics: Ultimates | Issue = #10 | Date = April 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Invisible Woman traps the Maker into a small psychic bubble, but he survives.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Jonathan Hickman]] | Penciller = [[Esad Ribic]] and [[Brandon Peterson]] | Colorist = [[John Rauch]] | Title = Ultimate Comics: Ultimates | Issue = #12 | Date = June 2012 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] }}</ref> Later, the Maker assembles part of the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref>\'\'Ultimate Comics: Ultimates\'\' #25.

While working on stopping another, he finds the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] escaping from another destroyed Earth.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' vol. 5 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following the final incursion, Reed and the Cabal escape the destruction of Earth-1610 in a "life-raft" created for that purpose. Learning that they are on a [[Battleworld|new world]] ruled by [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor]] Doom using the power of the [[Beyonders]] and [[Molecule Man]], Reed works with his Earth-616 counterpart to devise a means of defeating Doom. However, they are divided due to their morals, as Ultimate Reed wishes to kill their enemy while 616-Reed is more concerned with ensuring that the world can survive without him.<ref>\'\'Secret Wars\'\' (2015 series) #6.

However, Molecule Man intervenes, returning Reed to normal while turning the Maker into pepperoni pizzas.<ref>\'\'Secret Wars\'\' vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===New Avengers===\nDespite this, the Maker survives and emerged in the new Prime Earth, where he forms the science-based terrorist organization W.H.I.S.P.E.R. to continue experimenting for his own gain. His first experiment focuses on harnessing the souls of the dead to try and capture the souls of previous universes.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' vol. 4 #1</ref> Maker also assembles a new incarnation of the [[Revengers]], with plans to have them face the New Avengers. They consist of Asti the All-Seeing, [[Paibok]], [[Vermin (comics)|Vermin]], [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|White Tiger]], and alternate versions of [[Angar the Screamer]] and Skar.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' vol. 4 #7.

Sunspot then delivers Maker to the government, which imprisons him in a special cell.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' vol. 4 #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Working with Project Oversight===\nMaker later appears as a member of Project Oversight. He was seen interrogating [[Eddie Brock]] about the incident revolving around the Grendel symbiote and [[Knull (comics)|Knull]] while stating that he is not the Mister Fantastic that Brock knows. In addition, he talked about how the Venom symbiote has lost its personality, saying it is just a guard dog now, that it can\'t give Brock powers anymore. When Brock asks Maker if he would be able to restore it, Maker states that the only way to do that is to connect it to the symbiote hive mind and the last person to do that was the late [[Flash Thompson]].<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Maker was unable to get the answer from Brock about what happened to the same of the Grendel symbiote. He even reveals the symbiote bio-mass that was extracted by Flash\'s corpse as he plans to exhume and vivisect it. This causes the Venom symbiote to retaliate and trap Maker in a morgue locker. After getting out, he reaches a room to delete the footage of him being attacked by the Venom symbiote while also viewing the events of "[[Spider-Geddon]]" and "[[Infinity Countdown]]."<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' vol. 4 #8.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Maker shows his concern that Eddie will not survive long being forcefully separated from the Venom symbiote. After turning up the volume the symbiote is successfully removed from Eddie, however incapacitating both Maker and Eddie.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' vol. 4 #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nUltimate Reed Richards\'s power of elasticity has been increased in comparison to his [[Mister Fantastic|counterpart]]\'s. He can stretch his eyes, specifically the lens, so that he does not need his glasses or any other visual augmentation, but can only sustain this for short periods. It\'s revealed that his abilities allow him to stretch his brain in order to accommodate and solve almost any problem, thus making him effectively a human computer, so Reed is a genius with an [[IQ]] of at least 267 at age 16.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four\'\' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Ultimate Reed cannot stretch indefinitely: catching the falling [[Carol Danvers]] after she is dropped by the Silver Surfer, he admits that it hurt him to stretch that far.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four\'\' #44. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Ultimate Reed experiences an increase in his intellect from the accident that empowered him, making his "mind as flexible as his body". He has shown a reduced need for sleep due to the hyper-efficient workings of his brain.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four\'\' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultimate Reed\'s body has been radically transformed, his only internal organ being a "bacterial stack" that generates energy to fuel his body.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four\'\' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> This obviates the need to explain, for example, how his [[circulatory system]] can pump his blood when his body is stretched the length of a football field; he simply has none. Lacking a digestive system, he has no need to eat or drink. Similarly, because he has no lungs, Ultimate Reed does not need to breathe in any conventional human sense and can survive in environments lacking oxygen; during his time in the N-Zone, where the atmosphere is essentially acid and contains [[anti-matter]], he is able to survive.<ref>\'\'Cataclysm: The Ultimates\' Last Stand\'\'. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUltimate Reed is extremely durable, surviving a nova flame attack from the Human Torch, ionic attacks from the [[Alternative_versions_of_the_Thing#Ultimate_Marvel|Thing]] and having his brain blown up by [[Alternative_versions_of_Invisible_Woman#Ultimate_Marvel|Susan Storm]]\'s force fields.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Doomsday\'\'</ref> The Maker can split himself into multiple sentient beings that can operate separately from one another.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates\'\' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret War]], the Maker was split into an infinite number of beings by the [[Molecule Man]], who placed one version of the Maker in each of the newly formed universes being created by his Earth-616 counterpart and [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]. Each of these versions shares the same consciousness, allowing them to operate independently. This also enables him to teleport by switching between different versions of himself from different universes, and to transport weapons from other universes, which makes it difficult to disarm him.<ref>\'\'The Ultimates 2\'\' vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Brashear fields can be used to block his access to other dimensions.\n\n==Other versions==\nDuring the "Eternity War" arc, an alternate version of the Maker (sharing the same consciousness as the one imprisoned by the New Avengers) arrives on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] to collaborate with [[High Evolutionary]] to "evolve the entire multiverse".<ref>\'\'The Ultimates 2\'\' vol. 2 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Maker uses the High Evolutionary\'s machinery to destroy the Superflow that keeps the different universes separate, merging them into one reality to help Eternity fight the First Firmament.<ref>\'\'The Ultimates 2\'\' vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also uses the machine to revive the Earth-1610 Ultimates ([[Captain America (Ultimate Marvel character)|Captain America]], [[Iron Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Iron Man]], [[Hank Pym#Ultimate Marvel|Giant-Man]], [[Wasp (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Wasp]], and [[Hulk (Ultimate Marvel character)|Hulk]]) in case anyone tries to reverse his universal fusion.<ref>\'\'The Ultimates 2\'\' vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Earth-616\'s version of Ultimates arrive on Counter-Earth to confront Maker (who has made it easier for the First Firmament to "digest" Eternity), Maker doesn\'t believe them and orders the Earth-1610 Ultimates to attack. As both versions of Ultimates conclude that there is no reason to fight each other, Maker kills Ultimate Captain America for disobeying his orders. After having been frozen by [[Monica Rambeau|Spectrum]] and shattered by the High Evolutionary, both Ultimates help Eternity to defeat the First Firmament. Afterwards, the Earth-1610 Ultimates pursue the Makers across the universe.<ref>\'\'The Ultimates 2\'\' #100. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n* The Ultimate costume is the default skin for Mister Fantastic in the video games \'\'[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]\'\' and \'\'[[Marvel: Future Fight]]\'\'.

Reed helps to create the Quantum Gate which takes him, Ben, Johnny Storm and Victor von Doom to Planet Zero. The effects of Planet Zero gives Reed the ability to stretch. Blaming himself for the incident while being held at a government facility, Reed escapes and remains incognito. After being found by the military one year later, Reed is taken to Area 57 where he is persuaded to help repair the Quantum Gate. Things get worse when Victor resurfaces and plans to use Planet Zero to reshape Earth. After he, Ben, Johnny and Susan defeat Victor, they remain together as Reed is the one who comes up with their group name.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Reed_Richards_(Earth-1610) Reed Richards (Earth-1610)] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/maker/4005-133335/ Maker] at Comic Vine\n* [http://comicbookdb.com/character.php?ID=83782 Maker] at Comic Book DB\n\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n{{Ultimate Marvel}}\n{{Doctor Doom}}\n{{Symbiote Family and Hosts}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2004]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional child prodigies]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can stretch themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who committed familicide]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional terrorists]]\n[[Category:Fantastic Four]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]'}]}}}}
