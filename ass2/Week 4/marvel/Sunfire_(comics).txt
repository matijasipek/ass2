While in his first appearance Sunfire was called Shiro Yoshida, he story arc that introduced his cousin, Mariko, his name was spelled Yashida and this version of the name was carried on in Mariko\'s next appearances.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nSunfire is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to absorb solar radiation, and convert it to ionize matter into a fiery [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] state which bursts into flame when exposed to oxygen. Referring to his plasma output as "solar fire", he can release this energy through his hands as blasts of searing heat, deadly radiation, explosive concussive force, or simple flames. By ionizing the air around him, he can surround himself with an aura of heat intense enough to melt steel, or fly by focusing his aura downwards in a tight stream of ionized gas to propel him through the air like a rocket. Sunfire can see heat, by shifting his vision from visible light to [[infrared]].  Sunfire has the ability to form a psionic force field while using his plasma as protection from heat and radiation, both that of his own generation and that from outside sources. In a similar fashion to the [[Human Torch]]\'s nova burst, Sunfire is capable of increasing his plasma output to temperatures around 1,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and emitting it as an omnidirectional blast.\n\nSunfire transferred his powers to [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in order to defeat [[Lady Deathstrike]] who had just cut off his legs. This (like Ms. Marvel before him) left him still a mutant but powerless.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} After his transformation into Famine, a Horseman of Apocalypse, his powers and legs were returned, and he could now also use them to create flashes of light that affected the sections of the human brain which control hunger, causing any people who saw his light flashes to feel as if they were starving.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} Due to further genetic enhancement from Apocalypse, Sunfire is also able to secrete a specialized bio-oxygen from his skin, which allows him to breathe and conjure his flames even in the [[vacuum]] of space.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nShiro also seems to be quite an accomplished martial artist. He has displayed impressive hand to hand skills on several occasions and stated that he didn\'t need to employ his powers in order to defeat [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninjas.{{issue|date=November 2010}} He is trained in karate, judo, and kendo (Japanese Samurai swordsmanship). He is also an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers. He has at least peak human physical ability.\n\n==Other versions==\n===\'\'Age of Apocalypse\'\'===\nIn \'\'[[Age of Apocalypse]]\'\', Japan was destroyed by [[Holocaust (Marvel Comics)|Holocaust]], one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse. Shiro, a survivor of the massacre, was captured and given to [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] (the Horseman of Death), as a test subject for his experiments. Shiro\'s powers were pushed to their limits, causing his whole body to be set aflame, injuring him as a result. Shiro was rescued by the X-Men and joined them, taking on the codename Sunfire. Sunfire wore a containment suit to control his powers, although he was constantly on fire. Haunted by the destruction of his nation, Sunfire joined Rogue\'s task force of X-Men when they were sent to Chicago to fight Holocaust, who had begun a new series of Cullings. The character design of the original Sunfire as Famine (see above) is virtually identical to the Age of Apocalypse incarnation of the character.<ref>\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' #1-4 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the regular reality\'s X-Force crossed over into the Age of Apocalypse, Shiro was one of the few X-Men to return in order to prevent the destruction of Earth-616 by Archangel. Though he fought valiantly against the traitorous Iceman, seemingly killing him for his treachery, Shiro was killed while attempting to siphon energy from Holocaust\'s weapon of mass destruction, though he managed to buy X-Force precious moments with his sacrifice.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' #18 (Feb 2012).

When the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives-in-training dubbed the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]] investigated a terrorist attack, they discovered the existence of Project: Genesis and its link to Emperor Sunfire.

Sunfire and the Spider-Friends stopped the fire monster and Sunfire returned to Japan to have his uncle recover in a hospital.\n* Sunfire makes many appearances in the [[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men]] series, however most of those were non-speaking cameos merely serving the purpose of a stock character.
