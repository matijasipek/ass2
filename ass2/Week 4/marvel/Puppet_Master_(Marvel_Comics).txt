He moved to the United States at the age of eight. Growing up he was socially maladjusted and had no friends. (According to \'\'[[Spider-Man Family]]\'\' #4, his mother died when he was young and he was often picked on, which caused him to turn to his puppets for "friendship".)\n\nAfter he finished college he went into business with Jacob Reiss. Philip was jealous of Reiss\' wealth and of his family and decided to sabotage his workplace, but Reiss caught him in the act. The two of them break into a fight which results in an explosion that kills Reiss and blinds his daughter Alicia, who was also caught in the blast.\n\nPhillip plays the explosion off as an accident, and then starts a relationship Reiss\' wife, Marcia. He marries Marcia and adopts Alicia. Later, Marcia dies and it is more than he can bear and he loses his sanity. He begins experimenting with the radioactive clay puppets that he uses to control specific individuals\' bodies.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=281–282}}</ref> When the [[Human Torch]] interferes with one of his experiments, he sets about bringing down the Fantastic Four.

He is particularly concerned with guarding his precious Alicia from marrying the likes of the Thing.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} But he is later just as outraged when she is engaged to [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], also a member of the Fantastic Four.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nWith the Thinker and the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], Masters attempts to disrupt the wedding of the Human Torch and Alicia. The plan was to launch an attack on the church after the wedding ceremony, but when he sees how happy Alicia is to marry Johnny, Masters is overcome with remorse and turns on his associates, launching the [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]] against them: his wedding gift to Alicia and Johnny.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #300</ref>\n\nLater, Masters is reformed, remarried, and has a stepson; the toys he crafts for his son inadvertently caused a battle between [[Power Pack]] and the alien Ciegramites.<ref>\'\'Power Pack\'\' #60</ref> He reveals to the Thing that he had discovered that the Alicia Johnny had married was actually a [[Lyja|Skrull]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #357</ref>\n\nThe Puppet Master has been shown on two occasions attempting to leave his (overtly) criminal life behind. In the first, he found some measure of spiritual enlightenment in the service of the billionaire philosopher/cultist Satori. Satori employs Masters to construct a "perfect man" from his clay, which would then receive life and the power cosmic from the [[Silver Surfer]] and absorb Satori\'s mind, so that he might survive his body\'s death and serve as a proper leader to his flock.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Masters at some point left this cult, and entered a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]-maintained witness protection program, using his abilities to aid the government through the dulling of memories of other so-protected criminals\' previous associates. Masters reached out through his powers to control Ben Grimm and Alicia, duping Ben into a "married life" with his despondent daughter, whom Ben had stopped seeing years before. Ben was freed, but the Fantastic Four were prevented from taking any measure of revenge upon Masters, given his S.H.I.E.L.D. affiliation.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe Puppet Master returned to criminal life and affiliated himself with the [[Mad Thinker]]. Utilizing a device constructed by Mad Thinker, he was able to control a large number of non-super-humans, most notably members of the [[Yancy Street Gang]] to escalate a battle between the two different factions in the [[Civil War (comics)|superhero Civil War]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nIn that same issue he reveals that he always planned to kill the person he was working with in past team-ups and that he has anger management problems. Mad Thinker gives him the number of a good therapist. This exchange seems to contradict previous interactions between the two.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four #538\'\' (August, 2006)</ref>\n\nThe Puppet Master is then in the business of selling slaves (primarily females). Some of those under his control are superhuman females captured by members of the Chilean Army, and among those held captive are [[Dusk (comics)|Dusk]], [[Tigra]], [[Silverclaw]], [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]], and [[Anya Corazon|Araña]]. The Puppet Master also has random male slaves fight to the death.<ref>\'\'[[Ms. Marvel]] #18\'\'</ref> Once again the Puppet Master is presumed dead when he detonates explosives hidden beneath the house he used as a base, in a battle against [[Ms. Marvel]].<ref>\'\'Ms. Marvel\'\' #20</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, Puppet Master is seen in a comatose state in the Raft\'s infirmary. It is revealed that [[Purple Man]] was the one who had Puppet Master manipulate [[Misty Knight]]\'s [[Heroes for Hire]] organization to establish a criminal organization for him while he was in jail. Before he could kill Puppet Master, Elektra and Shroud arrive and prevented Purple Man from killing Puppet Master. Purple Man spared Puppet Master and took control of some inmates to attack Elektra and Shroud before escaping from the Raft.<ref>\'\'Heroes for Hire\'\' #9-10</ref>\n\nPuppet Master later appears by Misty Knight\'s side where he uses the villains on Misty Knight\'s side as payback on Purple Man.<ref>\'\'Villains for Hire\'\' #3</ref>\n\nLater, the Puppet Master has been murdered, with all evidence pointing to the Thing as the person responsible. The crime took place in a sealed room that even Mister Fantastic could barely enter with Alicia as the only witness, and even she cannot decipher what has happened.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' vol.5 #7</ref> Although the Thing claims innocence, he allows himself to be locked up.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' vol. 5 #8</ref> As it turns out, the dead Puppet Master was a decoy and the real Puppet Master had been hidden away by the Quiet Man, the mastermind behind Thing\'s framing and other misfortunes the Fantastic Four had suffered. Mister Fantastic later finds the real Puppet Master captive in the Quiet Man\'s building.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #645</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Puppet Master have no true superpowers, but he does possess a very gifted mind, as well as doctorate in [[biology]]. He has extensive knowledge of [[Workmanship|craftsmanship]] and experimental science. His greatest strength was the skill to create lifelike marionette puppets with extreme speed after Masters molded on those real people. Through intense concentration, Masters is able to control the physical actions of anyone whom that he sculpts from. For how he did this had never adequately explained other than using some type of special neurokinetic clay. The clay he mixed within this solution can be [[Mysticism|mystical]], slightly [[Radiation|radioactive]], and found in a remote area near Wundagore Mountain (Transia), site to the prison of an elder god Chthon. He cannot control the actions of essentially mindless creatures or supremely strong-willed beings. His manipulative skills are limited to one person at a time, even by far distance. While in his clay form, he possesses its unique features. Masters could split himself into 1/10 smaller replicas, each with a psychic link and shape-changing capabilities. Unfortunately, these abilities were lost, thanks to the Sphinx.<ref>\'\'The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\'\' Vol 1 #10 (September 1986)</ref> <ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z\'\' Vol 1 #9 (July 2009)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Puppet Master appeared in the 1982 \'\'[[The Incredible Hulk (1982 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]\'\' episode "Bruce Banner: Unmasked", voiced by [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} He gets control of the residents in Mesa City while also attempting to control the [[Hulk]] - his Hulk \'doll\' even allows him to exert some slight influence over Bruce Banner, although Banner simply feels uncomfortable rather than falling under the Puppet Master\'s control - simultaneously causing the Hulk\'s true identity to be revealed, although even when the Hulk is in his natural state his sheer strength of will allowed him to eventually throw off Puppet-Master\'s influence. The only person he doesn\'t make a puppet of is his stepdaughter Alicia, which allows Bruce and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick]] to track him down, Rick subsequently using the Puppet Master\'s equipment to erase all memory of the Hulk\'s true identity prior to its destruction.\n* The Puppet Master appeared in the two-part \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' episode "Origin of the Fantastic Four", voiced by [[Neil Ross]].<ref name="btva">{{cite web | title=Puppet Master Voice – Fantastic Four franchise <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors | url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Fantastic-Four/Puppet-Master/ | work=Behind The Voice Actors | access-date=December 22, 2019| postscript=.

He took control of the Thing and used him to capture Invisible Woman. Mister Fantastic freed the Thing from his control and defeated the Puppet Master. Upon returning to his apartment to reclaim his final doll, Puppet Master ended up in a fight with Alicia and then he apparently fell to his death from the apartment window. The Fantastic Four weren\'t able to find his body and claimed that he "vanished from Earth".\n* The Puppet Master appears in \'\'[[Fantastic Four: World\'s Greatest Heroes]]\'\' TV series, voiced by [[Alvin Sanders]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} As is the case with Alicia, the Puppet Master is African-American in this series. Debuting in the episode "Puppet Master," he was a sculptor whose clay was hit from a fragment of the same space station where the Fantastic Four were in when they got their powers. After touching his clay, he discovered he can manipulate the person of whoever he sculpts, resulting in him taking over the Thing and kidnapping the award-winning artists and Alicia. When the other Fantastic Four members arrived, the Puppet Master sculpted the Human Torch and took control of him until Alicia broke the sculptures and the Puppet Master is jailed. However, the ending hints at him escaping as he disguised some clay as a pair of sunglasses. In the episode "Strings", Puppet Master had manipulated his guards into bringing him enough of his clay to control all of the city officials like the mayor and the police chief. This allowed him to have the Fantastic Four evicted from the Baxter Building and turned into wanted criminals. Puppet Master\'s ultimate goal was to have Mister Fantastic enhance his powers, but he was foiled. In the final scene while locked up in the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]], he removes some clay from under his false teeth only for Invisible Woman to appear and take it from him.\n\n===Film===\n* In the extended edition of the \'\'[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' [[DVD]], the Thing notices puppets in a scene with Alicia Masters at her art gallery. She says that they belong to her father.<ref>\'\'[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' extended edition DVD</ref>\n\n===Video game===\n* The Puppet Master appeared in the 2005 \'\'[[Fantastic Four (video game)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' video game, voiced by [[James C. Mathis III]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Although the Fantastic Four doesn\'t fight him directly, he sends several exhibits at a museum (ex. [[Mummy|mummies]] and [[dinosaur]]s) after the Fantastic Four when they protect Alicia. In the end after the heroes destroyed the statue of [[Horus]], he escapes to the back door. Puppet Master\'s last line is "Next time, Fantastic Fools, the Puppet Master will not fail." The heroes aren\'t aware that he was responsible for the disaster, believing it instead to be a side-effect of the cosmic rays that gave them their powers. In the instruction booklet that comes with the game, Puppet Master\'s bio is given explaining that he uses radioactive clay to control whoever he chooses. This is probably how he made the exhibits in the museum come to life and attack the Fantastic Four.\n\n==Reception==\nIn August 2009, \'\'[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]\'\' listed the Puppet Master as one of the "Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters".<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/09/02/top-10-oddest-marvel-characters/slide/puppet-master/|title=Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters|date=August 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://marvel.com/characters/puppet-master Puppet Master] at Marvel.com\n* [https://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Phillip_Masters_(Earth-616) Puppet Master] at Marvel Database\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/puppet-master/4005-3799/ Puppet Master] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n{{New Warriors}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Jack Kirby}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1962]]\n[[Category:Fictional amorphous creatures]]\n[[Category:Fictional artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional biologists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional puppeteers]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional sculptors]]\n[[Category:Fictional toymakers and toy inventors]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who are shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Transians]]'}]}}}}
