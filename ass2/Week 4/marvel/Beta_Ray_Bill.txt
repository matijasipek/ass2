As such, Bill is the first being outside the [[Marvel Universe]]\'s [[Norse pantheon]] to be introduced as being worthy to wield Thor\'s hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. After an initial rivalry for possession of the weapon, the alien warrior was granted a [[war hammer]] of his own, called Stormbreaker, and the two reconciled as staunch allies, going on to fight side by side.\n\nBeta Ray Bill has been featured in other Marvel-endorsed products, such as [[:Category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]], [[video game]]s, and merchandise.\n\n==Publication history==\nBeta Ray Bill debuted in \'\'[[The Mighty Thor]]\'\' #337 (November 1983), being established as an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] of the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Korbinite]] race.<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=47}}</ref>\n\nBill was created by [[Walt Simonson]] as a new concept for the title \'\'Thor\'\'. Simonson said,\n\n{{blockquote|I wanted to start fresh, and I thought a new character would be the way to go on that. My thinking was that comics are a short form, and one of the things that\'s mostly true about comics characters are what they look like ... I designed Bill deliberately as a monster, because I knew that people would look at it and go, "Oh my God, it\'s this evil guy." I deliberately wrote them so you weren\'t sure in the beginning if he was a good guy or a bad guy ... I chose the name for its alliterative qualities. Originally I was going to call him \'Beta Ray Jones\' because I really wanted a common name. My feeling was Bill was [[Everyman]] for this alien race ... I deleted \'Jones\' because ... there were too many Joneses floating around the Marvel Universe.<ref>Cooke, John B. (June 2004). "Walt Simonson Interviewed", \'\'Jack Kirby Collector\'\' #14, collected in \'\'Collected Jack Kirby Collector Volume 3\'\', {{ISBN|1-893905-02-0}}, p. 114.</ref>}}\n\nDuring a "Thor Spotlight" panel at the Baltimore Comic Con, August 28, 2010, Simonson further stated:\n\n{{blockquote|One of the cool things about Thor was the enchantment around Mjolnir and the original inscription on it. So I thought, well that means someone else can pick up this hammer and get this power, if they\'re worthy! So since then, some other big characters, people\'s favorites, have picked up the hammer, Captain America, Superman, whoever. But at this point, no one had ever picked up the hammer. I liked the idea of Cap walking to the bathroom and seeing it, and grabbing and just tugging, not being able to. So this had to be someone new. This is the most powerful weapon of the Norse gods. This hammer is a killing weapon. It\'s used to kill Frost Giants and others. So, Superman couldn\'t pick it up, cause he\'s never going to kill anyone, and the hammer knows that. Captain America, he\'s too patriotic. He\'s too much a symbol of America to be chosen by this Norse artifact. So he couldn\'t get it. So I created Bill because he\'s noble, and he\'s designed to kill. He\'s got a great purpose as a warrior, and also the noble ability. That makes him "worthy" whatever that may be.\n\nAs far as appearance, back then, comics were these self-contained stories. So for Bill, I had to do this in short form. This was a four-issue story, and that was my longest on my entire run on Thor. We had to take him, make him into a character that the Hammer would recognize. So I wanted for Bill, I wanted him to have a "monstrous" look as a visual, so that everyone would think he\'s a bad guy, and I got letters after the first issue that said "What on earth? Why is this monster picking up the hammer, what\'s wrong with you?" and I said "I got it!" So I basically started with a skull, and then I made him a bit like a horse, with the gap behind the teeth. But horses are beautiful creatures. So what I was aiming for is a sense of death, a sense of monster, underlined by beauty. His costume was the same so that the minute you see that image, when he strikes the stick and becomes "Beta Ray Thor" or whatever, you know: OK, that guy has the powers of Thor. So that\'s why Bill had the monstrous face, that\'s why that stuff was done the way it was done.<ref>[http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/news/wsimonson_brbill "Thor Spotlight" panel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903191120/http://www.cosmicbooknews.com/news/wsimonson_brbill |date=September 3, 2010 }}; Baltimore Comic Con; August 28, 2010.

He appeared in the \'\'[[Maximum Security (comics)|Maximum Security]]\'\' crossover in January 2001 and the \'\'[[Secret Invasion]]\'\' crossover in 2008.  He starred in the six-issue miniseries \'\'Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill\'\' and its two follow-ups, the one-shot \'\'Beta Ray Bill: The Green of Eden\'\' and three-issue \'\'Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter\'\'. A new \'\'Beta Ray Bill\'\' series began in 2021 with a confrontation with [[Fin Fang Foom]].{{cn|date=April 2021}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===1980s===\nSpy organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] detected an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] fleet passing through Earth\'s galaxy, with Director [[Nick Fury]] asking Thor to investigate. When Thor finds the advanced ship, it scans Thor and perceives him to be a threat.  Unable to stop Thor, the sentient shipâ€”called \'\'Skuttlebutt\'\'â€”revives Beta Ray Bill, who is in [[suspended animation]]. Bill battles Thor to a standstill, until the ship reaches the Solar system, where one of the mystical enchantments of Thor\'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] comes into effect, which means that Thor will revert to his mortal persona of Donald Blake if separated from the hammer for more than 60 seconds. When that happens, Blake is knocked unconscious by Bill, who examines Blake\'s cane (Mjolnir\'s "shell" when Thor is in Blake\'s form) and on striking the cane receives Thor\'s power and a variant of his costume.\n\nOnce \'\'Skuttlebutt\'\' arrives on Earth, Bill easily defeats an approaching S.H.I.E.L.D. team and is then transported to Asgard by the King of the Norse gods, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], who mistakes Bill for Thor. After some initial confusion, Odin returns Thor to Asgard, and Bill\'s origin is revealed. Bill\'s race, the Korbinites, were almost rendered [[extinct]] when their galaxy exploded. The remnants of the Korbinite race fled in a fleet of warships, guarded by a [[Sentience|sentient]] ship called \'\'Skuttlebutt\'\' and a dedicated champion, Beta Ray Bill. Via Korbinite science, Bill was physically augmented and given the attributes of an [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] wild beast (a process that killed all of Bill\'s predecessors). \'\'Skuttlebutt\'\' attacked Thor because the ship recognized the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] magic as similar to that of the previous global threat, and assumed the Korbinites were being threatened once again.\n\nOn discovering that Bill was worthy enough to lift Mjolnir, Odin proposes a battle to the death in the fiery Asgardian realm of Skartheim to decide who will wield the hammer. Bill and Thor render each other [[unconsciousness|unconscious]]. Bill\'s resistance to heat allows him to recover first, however, and he is deemed the winnerâ€”but he also saves Thor from falling into lava, believing he is too worthy an opponent to die, but he feels he needs the hammer to protect his people. After Bill reconsiders his claim to the hammer, Odin orders the making of a new hammer for Bill: Stormbreaker, equal in power to Mjolnir and created from the same metal and by the same dwarfs led by [[Eitri (comics)|Eitri]]. Odin also transfers an enchantment from Mjolnir to Stormbreaker, so that Bill can return to his original Korbinite form by striking Stormbreaker upon the groundâ€”and Thor can no longer become Donald Blake. After learning that the mishap that killed most of Bill\'s people was caused by the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]], one of Asgard\'s most powerful enemies, Bill agrees to join the Asgardians in a war to stop Surtur and his armies.<ref name="Thor337">\'\'Thor\'\' #337â€“340 (November 1983 â€“ February 1984)</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/21/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-202/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics â€“ Day 202 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=July 21, 2010 |access-date=September 28, 2010 |archive-date=September 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910235720/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/07/21/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-202/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBill leads many of Earth\'s heroes against Surtur\'s forces on Earth while Thor, Odin, and Thor\'s adopted brother [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] confront Surtur in Asgard.

Thor throws Mjolnir at Bill, who catches it, proving he really is Bill. After being nursed back to health, the character retrieves his hammer.

After a brief confrontation with the herald, Stardust, Bill is intercepted by the [[Silver Surfer]], who is puzzled by the Korbinite\'s apparently futile quest to destroy Galactus. During a brief battle, Bill explains that while he understands he cannot hope to destroy Galactus with his power alone, he intends to destroy Galactus by annihilating any and all worlds Galactus seeks to feed from, thus starving him to death. The character\'s obsession with stopping Galactus eventually results in him being unable to lift his own enchanted weapon, an object that can only be wielded by the worthy. Equipped with alien weapons, Bill finds Galactus  but discovers the entity already under attack by another race. In a moment of conscience, Bill saves Galactus.

Bill eventually came to visit Thor- now calling himself \'Odinson\'- and offered his old friend Stormbreaker instead, only for Odinson and Bill to be captured by the Collector as they examined the remains of Asgard where the hammer of an alternate version of Thor had recently crashed. Although the Collector tried to force Odinson to help him find some means of bypassing the worthiness enchantment so that he could lift the hammer himself, Odinson eventually escaped and used the hammer\'s power to return Asgard to its original place. Once free, Odinson told Bill that the secret Fury had shared with him was "Gorr was right", a reference to Thor\'s old foe [[Gorr the God Butcher]] who believed that all gods brought nothing but pain and suffering to the universe. However, Bill assured Odinson that, regardless of his ability to wield Mjolnir, even if the gods were not worthy, Odinson proved himself to be a hero as he continued to fight for humanity even when officially unworthy.<ref>\'\'The Unworthy Thor\'\' #1-#5</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Redirect|Stormbreaker (comics)|Thor\'s second hammer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe|Stormbreaker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\nBeta Ray Bill\'s life force and consciousness were transferred by scientists of his race into the body of an alien carnivorous equine-like beast that had been bionically restructured into a cyborg.
