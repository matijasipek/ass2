(comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] facility is destroyed, and the sky on Earth is filled by a flash that seemed to enter Frances. When patrons came to her assistance, she lashed out, stabbing a customer. She ran out and began driving, only to crash and met a man who she called \'father\'. This man was Professor Horton, long dead, who turned out to be an escaped clone from the S.W.O.R.D. facility. Upon hear him calling her \'Frakie\', Frances burst into flames causing a massive explosion which kills the clone of Frankie\'s father."<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Kathryn Immonen|Immonen, Kathryn]]|penciller= [[Tonči Zonjić|Zonjić, Tonči]]|inker= Zonjić, Tonči|story= Heaven or Las Vegas|title= Heralds|issue= #1|date= August 2010}}</ref>\n\nFrances awoke in a ditch, trying to muster the strength to get up.

Frances went with them to the [[Baxter Building]], home of the Fantastic Four, in the hopes of obtaining some answers. They were amazed by Frances\' resemblance to their old friend Frankie Raye, the one who would become Nova: Herald of Galactus. Though Nova was long dead, somehow S.W.O.R.D. had a similar entity captured and Frances appeared to be almost the same girl who once hosted it. When the clones escaped the S.W.O.R.D. holding facility in Nevada, so did the Nova entity and it bonded with Johnny Storm while looking for Frankie.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Immonen, Kathryn|penciller= Zonjić, Tonči|inker= [[James Harren|Harren, James]]|story= Dreams Never End|title= Heralds|issue= #2|date= August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Nova entity escaped Johnny but when it was unable to take Frances, it fled setting a trap at Frankie Raye\'s former apartment.<ref>\'\'Heralds\'\' #3</ref> After relaying the story of the Silver Surfer, who at some point in time, approached a 14 year old Frances and placed a portion of Frankie Raye\'s essence into her hoping to later reunite it with the Nova essence, Frances went to Frankie\'s apartment in order to attempt to awaken more of Frankie\'s memories. There, the Nova entity kidnapped [[Valeria Richards]], daughter of Mister Fantastic and the [[Invisible Woman]], instead. Frances accompanied the team into space where they discovered Valeria and the Nova entity in the heart of a star. The Nova entity cocooned Valeria in a strange substance. That substance turned out to be the suit Professor Horton had made for Frankie Raye to suppress her powers long ago, somehow animated by the Power Cosmic becoming the "Nova entity" itself.<ref>\'\'Heralds\'\' #4</ref>\n\nEmma Frost sensed that both Valeria and the Nova entities minds were active in this cocoon. The Invisible Woman and She-Hulk managed to pull Valeria from the living suit while Frances looked on in horror. When the suit attempted to bond with the Invisible Woman, it spoke to Frances. It told her to save them, to be brave. Frances knew what she had to do, jumping in the way to become bonded with the being, just as the Silver Surfer had told her would happen. While she was bonding with the suit, she remembered the words of Hellcat and Silver Surfer, claiming to not be as strong as they said she was. It is unknown what exactly happened after she became \'Supernova\', but she left the team abruptly, returning to Earth. Although Frances was unchanged on the inside, she now was confused and possessed great power. She returned to the diner where she worked, not knowing what she was looking for. Following a conversation with the new waitress, Frances flew away trying to figure out what she wanted with her new life.<ref>\'\'Heralds\'\' #5</ref>\n\nIt was left ambiguous however if Frances Hyatt was actually a separate person that was randomly chosen by the Silver Surfer to be the one to bond with the remaining essence and powers of the slain Frankie or rather, she was actually a clone of Frankie Raye.{{original research inline|date=January 2020}} Nevertheless Frances as Nova was later recruited by the [[Fearless Defenders]] to fight the Doom Maidens.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Cullen Bunn|Bunn, Cullen]]|penciller= [[Will Sliney|Sliney, Will]]|inker= Sliney, Will|title=The [[Fearless Defenders]]|issue= #12|date= February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThor later summoned Nova along with other former Heralds of Galactus to Asgard after the Devourer of Worlds crash landed there following his confrontation with the Black Winter.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' vol. 6 #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nNova originally gained her superhuman powers as the result of a mutagenic reaction to an exposure to unknown chemicals. Originally, she had powers similar to that of the Human Torch: flame generation, projection, and flight.\n\nHer powers were later enhanced exponentially by the infusion of cosmic energies by the world-devourer Galactus. She gained metahuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. She had the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of stellar fire, and which allowed her to project any form of energy possessed by a star, including heat, light, gravity, radio waves and charged particles. She also had the ability to project streams of stellar fire for distances in the hundreds of miles, and to mentally control the flame she projects (for instance, to maintain a sustained ring around a person or object at a fixed distance). She also has the ability to fly at superluminal speeds through intergalactic space and traverse hyper-space. Finally, she possessed near-total physical invulnerability, as was evident when she was once punched by [[Rachel Summers|Phoenix III]] with such force that it launched her from Earth and slammed her into the moon\'s surface, forming an impact crater in the process.<ref name="Excalibur">{{cite comic| writer= [[Chris Claremont|Claremont, Chris]]|penciller= [[Chris Wozniak|Wozniak, Chris]]|inker= [[Al Milgrom|Milgrom, Al]]|story= Guess Who\'s Coming for Phoenix?|title= [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]|issue= #25|date= Early August 1990}}</ref> She later expressed amazement that she was able to even survive such a blow, let alone withstand it completely uninjured.<ref name="Excalibur"/> Nova\'s entire body, particularly her head, is plumed with cosmic energy resembling flames.\n\nFrankie Raye was fluent in more than one language besides English.\n\n==Other versions==\nAn [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] encountered Nova in the 24th century in the first \'\'Hercules\'\' limited series by writer/artist [[Bob Layton]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= [[Bob Layton|Layton, Bob]]|penciller= Layton, Bob; [[Sam de la Rosa|de la Rosa, Sam]]|inker= Layton, Bob; de la Rosa, Sam|story= — Not Just Another Galactus Story!|title= [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] |issue= #4|date= December 1982}}</ref>\n\nWriter-penciler [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and inker [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] produced a serialized story titled "The Last Galactus Story",  which appeared in the [[anthology]] comics-magazine \'\'[[Epic Illustrated]]\'\' #26-34 (October 1984 - February 1986),<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= [[Terry Austin (comics)|Austin, Terry]]|story= The Shattered Stars (Chapter One)|title= [[Epic Illustrated]]|issue= #26|date= October 1984}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The Shadows in the Stone (Chapter Two)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= #27|date= December 1984}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= Return of the Exile (Chapter Three)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= #28|date= February 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The Rhyming Robot (Chapter Four)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= #29|date= April 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The End of the Earth (Chapter Five)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= #30|date= June 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The Hidden Stars (Chapter Six)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= #31|date= August 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= Tunnel in the Sky (Chapter Seven)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= #32|date= October 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= [[Bob Wiacek|Wiacek, Bob]]|story= The Dweller in Darkness (Chapter Eight)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= #33|date= December 1985}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Austin, Terry|story= The Face of the Foe (Chapter Nine)|title= Epic Illustrated|issue= #34|date= February 1986}}</ref> and detailed an all-new adventure for the character.
