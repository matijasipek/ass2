Once inside, Azazel took great pleasure in toying with the team, having them believe that he was actually Satan. In the end, the X-Men defeated Azazel and his army and banished him to an unknown oblivion. The X-Men, including Nightcrawler, were able to escape, along with two other children of Azazel: Abyss and Kiwi Black.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #429-434.</ref>\n\n=== Return ===\nAzazel\'s whereabouts were unknown for several years, but he resurfaced in this dimension, accompanied by a few Azazel-like Bamfs, revealing himself to be the master of Calcabrina, former ally of Frankenstein\'s Monster, and banned from all realms of Hell.<ref>\'\'Amazing X-Men\'\' #1-5.</ref>\n\n=== Weapon X-Force ===\nAzazel was confronted by a shape-shifted Mystique (who he easily recognized), looking for his assistance with going to a realm of Hell to fight the newly resurrected demonic William Stryker with Weapon X-Force hiding in the background. Saber tooth, seeing that he was just flirting and she wasn\'t getting anywhere, urged the rest of the team to come out of hiding and attack Azazel, to force him to transport them to the Hell Stryker resided in. Easily defeating the team, he then obliged their request once he remembered how Mystique sired a child with another man, Saber tooth, that wasn\'t him. He swiftly delivered a blow to Saber tooth, by slicing his head clean off with his sabre, sending him to the correct realm of Hell first, ruled by Marduk Kurios, then followed by the rest of the team.<ref>\'\'Weapon X\'\' Vol 3 #25</ref><ref>\'\'Weapon X\'\' Vol 3 #26</ref>\n\nWith the whole team being sinners and killers designated for eternal damnation, he "killed" Weapon X-Force despite their potent regenerative healing factors. In reality, he was keeping their bodies in suspended animation through his teleportation power, freezing them in time and space, and allowing their souls to go to Hell. Since their bodies were frozen, their healing factors didn\'t kick in and revive them until after Azazel unfroze them when they were done in Hell.<ref>\'\'Weapon X\'\' Vol 3 #27</ref>\n\n=== House of X ===\nAzazel was eventually welcomed to the new mutant island of Krakoa, created by Xavier, Magneto, and Moira X. He entered through the teleportation gateway alongside other villainous and fractious mutants, who had been invited to join the nation in order to heal mutantdom and start over as a whole species together.<ref>\'\'House of X\'\' #5</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Here Are All the X-Men Villains That Showed up in Marvel\'s House of X #5 |url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/marvel-house-x-5-x-men-villains-cameos-list/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=Marvel |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Adams |first=Tim |date=2019-09-18 |title=House of X Opens Krakoa\'s Doors to the X-Men\'s Greatest Villains |url=https://www.cbr.com/house-of-x-krakoa-x-men-villains/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=CBR |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nAzazel is an immortal mutant.<ref>\'\'Marvel Zombies: The Book of Angels, Demons & Various Monstrosities\'\' #1</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Greene |first=Nancy O. |date=2018-08-01 |title=20 Marvel Superheroes And Villains Who Are Actually Related |url=https://screenrant.com/marvel-superheroes-villains-related-family/ |access-date=2022-10-11 |website=ScreenRant |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=C.

He is the assistant of Sebastian Shaw and works alongside his other allies Riptide and Emma Frost. He displays incredible teleporting abilities, similar to that displayed by Nightcrawler in the film \'\'[[X2 (film)|X2]]\'\' but ranging over a much greater distance, and hand-to-hand combat skills, assisted by a short sword and a sharp tail on which he impales his victims. He is of Russian origin, speaking with a Russian accent and at times using Russian phrases, such as "nyet" and "comrade". At the film\'s climax, he engages Beast in a brutal fight until Beast finally knocks him out, and following the death of Shaw and paralysis of Xavier, Azazel joins [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]\'s [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].\n* In the sequel \'\'[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]\'\', it is revealed that Azazel is among the mutants experimented on and killed by [[Bolivar Trask]]. In viral marketing, it is mentioned that he and [[Angel Salvadore]] were killed by [[Project Wideawake]] members.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/flemyng-being-dad-wins-over-xmen-29115995.html "Flemyng: Being dad wins over X-Men"]. \'\'[[Irish Independent|The Independent]]\'\'.
