His mother, Lu Wei, opted to get into the [[United States]], albeit illegally, to have a better life. Sometime later, Lu gave birth to a daughter, and Sam\'s sister, Hannah who due to being born on U.S. soil became a legal citizen. Neither of their fathers have been identified.<ref name="D527">\'\'Daredevil\'\' vol. 5 #27</ref> Years later, Sam began working as a janitor at [[Columbia University]] where he began stealing various designs to create an invisibility suit for himself. Going by the name Blindspot, Sam decided to become a vigilante all without telling Hannah. One night he encountered [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] who was able to "see" Sam due to his "radar sense".<ref>\'\'All-New, All-Different Marvel Point One\'\'</ref> He begins taking lessons from him while also working for Chinese criminal Tenfingers on the side with Lu.

She patches him up, but has to wear a cast for about a month and thus, has to take time off from his usual janitorial job. Luckily for him, Daredevil tells Sam that Matt Murdock (his own double identity) will hire him as a legal assistant to help him out.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' vol. 5 #6-7</ref> Sam\'s next outing as Blindspot had him going after the psychopathic villain Muse who managed to out do him. When Daredevil arrived to rescue him, Sam\'s eyes were gouged out. Daredevil ended up defeating Muse and Sam was kept sedated at St. Luke\'s Presbyterian Hospital.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' vol. 5 #13-15</ref> Lu returned to restore Sam\'s eyesight, but converted him to the Hand while also attempting to make a deal with a demon simply called the Beast. He then lured Daredevil into a trap where he would learn that he and Murdock were one and the same. Eventually, Sam would come around to helping his mentor, resulting in his mother sacrificing herself for her son and he and Daredevil returning to the U.S.<ref name="D527" />\n\nMuse would escape custody resulting in Sam setting out to seek revenge. He is once again overpowered, but suddenly receives power from the Beast. However, Sam refused to kill Muse, resulting in Muse killing himself and the Beast launching a Hand assault on New York.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #598-600</ref> Sam recruited Daredevil to help in defeating the members.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #602</ref> The Beast offered to end his invasion if Sam handed himself over, which he agreed. However, Sam suddenly found himself defended by Daredevil and Commissioner Nalini Karnik. When the Hand began attacking them, they were suddenly aided by the arrival of [[Moon Knight]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Luke Cage]] and the Ordo Draconum (Order of the Dragon). Daredevil finally defeated the Beast and Sam was eyed as a potential recruit for the Draconum due to his courage.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #605</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe mutant version of Blindspot has the ability to absorb and give memories to people, but they have to be existing memories. She can only affect organic beings as she was incapable of affecting Deathstrike due to her cybernetic parts. She is also immune to Rogue\'s absorbing powers.\n\nSam Chung is an expert martial artist due to his intense training which was greatly enhanced with his training from the Hand. He is also a skilled acrobat from a young age. Essentially, his skills are just beneath Daredevil\'s own abilities. He also seems to possess high intelligence, as he created the invisibility suit himself.\n\n==Other characters named Blindspot==\n*A female Blindspot was part of a fake version of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]]. She possessed photokinesis (the ability to control light) and worked under [[Simon Trask]].
