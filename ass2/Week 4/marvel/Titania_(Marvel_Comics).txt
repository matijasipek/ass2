Titania begins to work for Doom in earnest, and is one of the villains ordered by Doom to attack the superheroes.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> She battles [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]],<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars\'\' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars\'\' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> as well as the [[X-Men]]. She eventually gets the better of [[She-Hulk]] beginning a long rivalry between the two.<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars\'\' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref name=":3" />\n\nWhen the heroes later storm Doombase to rescue She-Hulk, Titania tries to face up against veteran superhero [[Spider-Man]]. Initially extremely confident due to her massive strength and durability, she panics upon realizing that Spider-Man\'s vastly superior speed, agility, reflexes, intelligence and years of experience against more powerful foes allow him to not only easily avoid her, but also attack her with complete impunity. The fight ends when Spider-Man beats her into the ground, then picks her up and disdainfully tosses her through an exterior wall.  During this fight, Titania\'s newfound arrogance quickly evaporates, giving way to what Spider-Man mockingly calls the "whining little wimp-ette"&nbsp;— it is clear that her arrogance masks an insecure, fragile personality.<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars\'\' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mindful of this beating, Titania avoids coming into contact with Spider-Man while on Battleworld,<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars\'\' #11 (1985).

Once Owen Reece, the [[Molecule Man]], manages to seal off the chunk of Denver and navigate it toward Earth, Creel and MacPherran reveal that they are done with Doom and his war and simply want to go home.<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars\'\' #11-12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the return to Earth, Titania beats up Vanessa Ashwood and destroys her house, but gets no satisfaction out of getting revenge on her childhood tormentor.<ref name="She-Hulk vol. 1 #10 2004"/>\n\n===Back to Earth===\nOnce back on Earth, Titania and Absorbing Man continue to work as professional criminals by joining [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]\'s latest incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #273. Marvel Comics.</ref> Their first assignment is to recruit the powerful [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], which also prevents them from joining the main group in the assault on [[Avengers Mansion]]. To kill time, Titania robs a jewelry store and attracts the attention of Spider-Man. Too afraid to fight him, she runs but encounters him again at [[LaGuardia Airport]]. Titania avoids fighting, having Creel do so on her behalf. The sight of his near-defeat at Spider-Man\'s hands proves enough for Titania to temporarily overcome her \'arachnophobia\', charging in to save her boyfriend. Creel ends the fight by threatening to destroy a plane full of innocents if Spider-Man refuses to leave the scene, which he reluctantly does.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man 1986"/>\n\nThe villain couple receive another assignment from the Masters: to kill [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] who had been gravely injured by the Masters, and was hospitalized. Despite being guarded by only [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]] and the [[Wasp (character)|Wasp]], Hercules survives. Creel is stung by insects in human form and Titania is shrunk to the size of Wasp. She is taken to the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]], a superhuman penitentiary.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #275. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe stay in the Vault does not last long. When [[Iron Man]] begins the [[Armor Wars]] (the battle to destroy or disable all enhanced armor types based on stolen Iron Man designs), it inevitably leads him to the Guardsmen, The Vault\'s wardens. The ensuing conflict creates a power failure, allowing Titania and [[Mister Hyde (Marvel Comics)|Mister Hyde]] to escape. While [[Captain America]] manages to subdue and capture Mister Hyde, his colleague [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]] is unsuccessful in apprehending Titania. When allowed the opportunity for a rematch, D-Man simply lets her escape because she is far stronger than him.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #340 (1988). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUsing her newfound freedom, Titania travels to Washington D.C. After losing a succession of battles with She-Hulk, Titania promises to never attack her again and returns to jail.<ref>\'\'Solo Avengers\'\' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBroken out yet again, Titania joins with the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and [[Hydro-Man]] to become the new [[Frightful Four]]. Battling the [[Fantastic Four]] with Titania taking on the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Sharon Ventura|Ms. Marvel]], the team only wins due to help from Professor Gregson Gilbert\'s creation [[Dragon Man (comics)|Dragon Man]] and [[Aron (comics)|Aron, the Renegade Watcher]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #326-328. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the rematch, the Fantastic Four prevails only to have both teams imprisoned by Aron in suspended animation, using clones of the Fantastic Four to act out adventures he wished to witness. When both teams are freed, Aron chooses to witness the dreams of his clones instead and transports the Frightful Four back to The Vault, as a service to the Fantastic Four.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #333 (1989). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTitania permanently overcomes her fear of Spider-Man during the 1989-1990 "[[Acts of Vengeance]]" crossover, in which a conspiracy between [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] and the Wizard teams supervillains to fight enemies not usually their own. Titania is dismayed when Doctor Doom, her partner, tells her she would face She-Hulk and not Spider-Man. With the help of a behavior modification device secretly affixed to Titania, Doom stokes her pride and anger, allowing her to engage Spider-Man at the [[Daily Bugle]] offices. After the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]\'s claws tear Doom\'s device from her she cowers from Spider-Man, but he makes her realize that she had been fighting him the whole time, and resumes attacking. At the time, Spider-Man was temporarily bonded with the [[Captain Universe|Uni-Power]], making him Captain Universe. This grants him the power to render Titania unconscious in one massive energy discharge.<ref>\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #59. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nShe is freed on the way to the Vault by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] who also collects the [[Trapster]] and the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]]. All had been humiliated by Spider-Man in the Captain Universe guise and along with [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Erik Josten|Goliath]], they make a failing attempt to take revenge. Titania is humiliatingly defeated by a collision with a speeding bus.<ref>\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #64-65.

Marvel Comics.</ref> This does not work out and Titania resolves to track down her old flame&nbsp;– the Absorbing Man, finding him battling the [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]] Thor. When she appears injured by a blow from [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], Creel admits his love for her which she gladly reciprocates. Seeing this, Thor allows them to leave.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #436. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile Creel makes an attempt to live a normal life, Titania goes back to robbing jewelry stores. Concerned, Creel attempts to "scare her straight", collaborating with Thor in a ploy involving an exhibit at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]. While the appearance of Spider-Man and special police unit Code: Blue complicates matters, ultimately Titania remembers her love for Creel.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #447–448. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCreel continues to get mad at Mary for not managing to stay legal and violating their parole. In order to alleviate her stress he arranges an official bout with She-Hulk, but Titania nonetheless decides to cheat and ends up losing the fight.<ref>\'\'Thunderstrike\'\' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTitania and the Absorbing Man\'s wedding is attended by many supervillains. While the Avengers interrupt the ceremony, they ultimately leave the couple alone.<ref>\'\'[[Avengers Unplugged]]\'\' #4</ref> Titania quickly grows bored with her law-abiding reform, and after Absorbing Man tries to buy her a Valentine\'s present but is nonetheless attacked by the police, they accept having to live a life on the run from the law.<ref>\'\'Marvel Valentine\'s Special\'\'</ref>\n\nIn need of funds the pair assumes the guises of Thunder Girl and Lightning Bolt in order to hunt Spider-Man for the reward offered by [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]].<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #429</ref> Despite Titania briefly contracting severe skin burns as a result of this escapade, the pair remains unable to reform and commit more robberies.

Creel kidnaps [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]] and brings her to the abandoned building to treat Titania, whose condition is rapidly deteriorating.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Due to a battle between Creel and Thor, the building collapses upon the two women. Weakened and barely conscious, but still massively strong, Titania is nonetheless able to save Foster from being killed by holding up the falling debris.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' (vol. 2) #26–27 (August–September 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref> Foster subsequently helps treat Titania\'s cancer at the hospital.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' (vol. 2) #28 (October 2000). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn a "silent" story containing no word balloons, Captain America fights the Absorbing Man on Christmas Eve, then learns that Creel was trying to get enough money to buy a Christmas present for Titania. Cap then secretly delivers the present in Creel\'s place, and remains outside their apartment window long enough to watch Titania pick up the gift. In an accompanying script excerpt, writer [[Dan Jurgens]] explains that Titania\'s illness has been cured.<ref>{{cite web| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20020203205228/http://marvel.com/comics/nuffsaid/capamerica50/part_4.htm | title= \'\'Captain America\'\' #50: PLOT for 22 pages| volume=3 | first= Dan | last= Jurgens |url= http://marvel.com/comics/nuffsaid/capamerica50/part_4.htm| website=Marvel Comics|archive-date= February 3, 2002| date= August 11, 2002 | access-date= April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring Christopher Priest\'s run on \'\'[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]\'\', Titania appears as a roommate of Deadpool and the supervillain [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]],<ref>\'\'[[Deadpool]]\'\' (vol. 3) #38 (March 2000).

However, She-Hulk had done so more efficiently, briefly reaching levels almost approaching those of the [[Hulk]] himself. Battered and inadvertently humiliated by her, Titania is offered the chance at revenge after obtaining the Power Gem, one of the legendary [[Infinity Gems]], from its former owner, the former [[Champion of the Universe]], now known as the Fallen One because of his own defeat at She-Hulk\'s hands. The Fallen One had agreed to cease using the Power Gem as a condition of his defeat, but was free to gain his own revenge by [[wikt:proxy|proxy]] through Titania. After an initial defeat by the newly empowered Titania, She-Hulk tricks her into believing that she had killed the Jade Giantess in a second battle; Titania\'s initial rush of triumph suddenly melts into uncertainty, as she realized that her life now had no meaning or focus without the object of her obsessive hatred. She-Hulk (in her normal form as Jennifer Walters) then takes advantage of Titania\'s confusion to pluck the Power Gem from the criminal\'s forehead, and uses the Gem\'s power to knock Titania out with a single punch.<ref name="ReferenceB">\'\'She-Hulk\'\' #12 (April 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTitania is incarcerated in the [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Lang]] Memorial Penitentiary, a.k.a. the [[Hank Pym|Pym]] Experimental Prison #2, a prison in which superhuman inmates are shrunk with Pym particles to less than an inch in height, to reduce both their chances of escape and their threat to guards and the public.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>\n\nTitania appears as a member of [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|The Wizard]]\'s Frightful Four, battling the Fantastic Four on Saturn\'s moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #547.

Marvel Comics.</ref> In the next issue, having escaped (though still shrunken to diminutive size), she is reunited with the Absorbing Man, and clashes again with She-Hulk. To save She-Hulk from the Absorbing Man, her friend, the [[Skrull]] [[Jazinda]] uses the shrunken Titania as a hostage and throws her into the mouth of a shark.<ref>\'\'She-Hulk\'\' (vol. 2) #23 (2008).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Fear Itself===\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, one of the seven Hammers of the Worthy lands near Titania after it was launched to Earth by [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]. When she lifts it, her body becomes possessed by Skirn: Breaker of Men.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Matt Fraction|penciller=Stuart Immonen |inker= Wade von Grawbadger|story=The Worthy| title=Fear Itself| volume= |issue=#2| date= July 2011| publisher=Marvel Comics| page= |panel=}}</ref> Skirn then helps Creel find his own hammer in the capital of Hell. When they find his hammer, they come across a well known thief who has a personal history with Skirn. The thief tries to take the hammer as his own, but Skirn quickly defeats him. [[War Machine]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and their allies appear and try unsuccessfully to keep the hammer from Creel, who becomes the host body for Greithoth): Breaker of Wills when he grasps it.<ref>\'\'Iron Man 2.0\'\' #6 (2011).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===All-New Thor===\nWhen Absorbing Man and Titania rob an armored car, the [[Jane Foster|female Thor]] appears to thwart their plans. Upon meeting the female Thor, Creel mocks her for being a woman and for having taken Thor\'s name for herself, which she answers by breaking his jaw. Titania then appears to confront her. But out of respect for what Thor was doing, she knocks out her husband with his own weapon and surrenders. Despite this surrender, and despite Titania having once saved her life, Thor hits her hard with Mjolnir, knocking her out.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' (vol. 4) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Illuminati===\nTitania attempts to quit the supervillain lifestyle, and with She-Hulk\'s help, gets a security job at a pawn shop. Though she successfully stops a robbery by thugs armed with energy weapons, her powers attract the attention of [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Despite her innocence, the Heroes for Hire view her with suspicion and attempt to subdue her. In the middle of the fight, the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] teleports Titania against her will back to his lair, where he invites her to join his incarnation of the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]], promising a way out of supervillainy. She reluctantly agrees to join. It is revealed to the reader that Hood engineered the robbery and is manipulating Titania.<ref>\'\'Illuminati\'\' #1 (2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOf her new teammates, Titania is closest with her friend, the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]] member [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]]. Over the short life of this team, she fights various supervillains, has a rematch with Thor, and temporarily exhibits new mystical powers, which manifest themselves as purple energy discharges while she uses her super strength.<ref>\'\'Illuminati\'\' #2-5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Avengers: Standoff!]]\'\' storyline, Titania and Hood attack Pleasant Hill to extract Absorbing Man. There is some brief tension between the reunited couple when Titania overhears Creel confess that he had feelings for [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] while he was under [[Kobik]]\'s brainwashing.<ref>\'\'Illuminati\'\' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the final issue of \'\'Illuminati\'\', the Hood, having expanded his team of supervillains with the former inmates of Pleasant Hill, plots to kill the Avengers\' family members out of revenge for the events of \'\'Avengers: Standoff!\'\' Titania feels that this crosses a moral line and refuses to go along. In the ensuing argument, Hood reveals that he manipulated Titania into joining the team and that he used his dark magic to give her new powers. They fight, and Titania, suspecting that Hood\'s mystical cloak and use of dark magic is corrupting his mind, destroys the cloak (which also removes her new powers) telling Hood that she is saving him from himself. Titania and Absorbing Man then resign themselves to remaining supervillains, though after seeing his wife stand up to the Hood and defeat him, Creel tells Titania that he can\'t believe that he ever had "mixed-up feelings for Elektra".<ref>\'\'Illuminati\'\' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Teaming with Black Bolt===\nIn the 2017 series \'\'Black Bolt\'\', the Absorbing Man is shown in a cosmic prison, where he befriends the Inhuman king [[Black Bolt]] and a telepathic alien girl named Blinky. Creel is seemingly killed fighting the prison\'s jailer, but successfully frees his fellow inmates.<ref>\'\'Black Bolt\'\' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Black Bolt and Blinky travel to Earth to inform Titania of her husband\'s heroic sacrifice. She mourns his death and arranges his funeral, which is attended by Captain America, Thor, and the Wrecking Crew. After the funeral, Black Bolt is attacked by [[Lash (comics)|Lash]]. Titania helps fight off the Inhuman villains, but is unable to prevent them from kidnapping Blinky.<ref>\'\'Black Bolt\'\' #9.

She calls Absorbing Man, warning him to stay out of trouble while she is away. As Weapon H leads the mission to Weirdworld, they are attacked by a tribe of blue-skinned humanoids called the Inaku, who blame them for breaking the Earth and allowing a shapeshifting race called the Skrullduggers to take their queen.<ref>\'\'Weapon H\'\' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Weapon H frees his comrades, Titania knocks out Protector Hara, resulting in the Inaku\'s protective dome being damaged. As [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]]\'s [[Man-Thing]] fortifies the Inaku village\'s defenses, Titania and Korg stay behind while Weapon H, Angel, and a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]]-infected human named Blake go on a stealth mission to the Roxxon outpost.

When Morgan le Fay of Earth-15238 shows up and is identified as the missing Inaku queen, Titania and Korg are attacked by Protector Hara, the Skrullduggers and Weapon H. Man-Thing comes to Titania\'s defense.<ref>\'\'Weapon H\'\' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Titana and Korg catch up to Weapon H, where they find that Dario Agger has transformed into Minotaur.
