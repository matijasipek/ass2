Originally depicted as a silent [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] character, he is portrayed by Carly Rees and voiced by Stephen Murdoch in the latter film.\n\n==Publication history==\nMiek was first seen in \'\'[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]\'\' vol. 3 #92 during the "[[Planet Hulk]]" storyline and was created by [[Greg Pak]] and [[Carlo Pagulayan]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMiek was a member of planet Sakaar\'s native race of [[insectoid]]s. When he was young, his father and most of his hive were attacked and killed by local Imperials, forcing Miek to flee underground. He was accidentally rescued, as an outcast slave, during Hulk\'s battle with the Red King. Soon after, the Warbound escaped with Miek secretly leading them to the place where his father was killed. The Warbound then aided him in securing his revenge. Miek and Brood, who have formed a connection due to their insect nature, freed Miek\'s brothers and added the Warbound to their Hive. Within a short time he underwent a metamorphosis and evolved into a giant heavily armoured "King" version of his race.\n\nMiek located one of the last Queens of his race, at an egg farm at which the Warbound were hiding. Unfortunately for Miek, and his species, the Queen was consumed by a Spike infection and had to be killed.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Miek led the Warbound in Hulk\'s place while [[Hulk]], [[Hiroim]], and [[Caiera]] attempted to obtain the allegiance of Caiera and Hiroim\'s people.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nFollowing the death of Caiera Oldstrong, Miek and the rest of the Warbound accompanied the Hulk back to Earth, where he pledged to aid him in a quest of vengeance against those responsible for the Hulk\'s forced exile.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #4 (2007)</ref>\n\nOn Earth, Miek was one of the most vocal in encouraging the destruction of the planet in revenge for what was done. By the end, it was revealed that Miek knew all along that the Illuminati were not responsible. Red King loyalists had planted a damaged warp core on the Hulk\'s ship hoping it would kill the Hulk. Miek did not tell the Hulk hoping it would encourage the Hulk to keep destroying. Enraged, the Hulk and [[No-Name]] nearly killed Miek.<ref>\'\'World War Hulk\'\' #5 (2007)</ref> After the Hulk\'s defeat Miek was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. in Wonderland and relayed information about the Warbound to help recapture them.<ref>\'\'World War Hulk Aftersmash: Warbound\'\' #1 (2008)</ref>\n\nFollowing the \'\'[[Secret Invasion]]\'\' storyline, Miek was presumably still imprisoned in the Negative Zone supervised by Wonderland\'s freed inmates.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Chaos War===\nMiek made a full recovery as he remained locked away in Prison 42 and stayed there until Amatsu-Mikaboshi became the Chaos King and attacked all of reality. As order gave way to chaos, Miek found his freedom along with many other prisoners. He pledged his service to the Chaos King, who sought to destroy everything much like Miek wished Hulk would.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nMiek, with an army of other former prisoners, attacked Amadeus Cho and Galactus as they attempted to complete a gateway to a pocket universe to save creation. Cho recognized him from the attack on New York but could not reason with him. Miek was unwilling to trust anything Cho said and tried to stop Cho from completing the gateway. Despite Miek initially had the upper hand and nearly killed Cho, an earthquake caused by the fight between Chaos King and Hercules caused him to lose his prey. Amadeus quickly knocked him with the Golden Mace, causing Miek to fly away.<ref>\'\'Chaos War\'\' #5</ref>\n\n===Planet Savage===\nMiek found that as a result of his exposure to the Chaos King\'s energies, he had become biologically female. This allowed her to lay clutches of eggs, but the hatchlings could not survive long after birthing. Miek found her way to the Savage Land, and in the process of asserting herself there, slaughtered forty-three Sakaarian refugees residing there. She had also grown considerably larger and more powerful through this time. Ka-Zar contacted Hulk regarding the deaths of the Sakaarians, and Hulk assembled his Warbound and headed there directly, despite the grievous injuries he\'d sustained from his battle with Zeus. During the Warbound\'s first night there, the Sakaarian elder had drugged the group, allowing Miek and her insect horde to abduct the Hulk. The elder had made an agreement with Miek that his people would be spared if he helped Miek obtain the Hulk as a sacrifice.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' vol. 2 #622</ref>\n\nMiek had attempted to supplant her hatchlings into the bodies of Sakaarians, to keep them fed and safe, but that had not worked. When attempting it with the Hulk\'s unconscious body, the hatchlings thrived. Using exceedingly strong insect chemicals, Miek kept the Hulk drugged and under mind control while her hatchlings gestated in Hulk\'s chest, even sending the mind-controlled Hulk against his own Warbound in an attempt to stop them from rescuing his captive. When the Hulk\'s rage burned off the mind control, Miek tried to convince the Warbound to help them keep her hatchlings alive.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' vol. 2 #623</ref>\n\nHulk then tore the infants from her chest and attempted to stomp them, before he set about killing Miek. Skaar then tackled Hulk, smashing his head into the ground, and calling him a "stupid monster". Skaar promised the infant insects that no one would hurt them and that he\'d care for them, as he could sympathize with their plight. Miek attempted to drug Skaar, to make him kill his father, only to have another of her arms chopped off by Hulk, who then punched Miek through a volcano and across the Savage Land into a mountain of ice. Hulk chased after and tried to save Miek, but Miek would not let him, and fell presumably to her death.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' vol. 2 #625</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a Sakaaran Native, Miek hatched from an egg in a grub-like larval stage and eventually entered a cocoon-like pupae stage after several months. Six months later, he emerged from his cocoon as an adult Native, with fully formed antennae, six limbs, and postpharyngeal glands used to communicate with other members of their familial hive. Later in life, Miek entered into a second pupae stage and emerged as a Native king, with an armor-like chitinous carapace, longer mandibles, clawed phalanges, and overall greater body mass.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] & Pak, Greg |penciller=[[Jim Calafiore|Calafiore, James]] |title=Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook |issue=#1 |date=July 19, 2006 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nAs a gladiator on Sakaar, he developed six-limbed fighting skills, often wielding four weapons at a time to keep his opponents off-balance.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] & Pak, Greg |penciller=[[Jim Calafiore|Calafiore, James]] |title=Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook |issue=#1 |date=July 19, 2006 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===\'\'Marvel Zombies Return\'\'===\nIn the 4th issue of \'\'[[Marvel Zombies Return]]\'\', when Hulk and the Warbound land on the moon they are met by zombiefied versions of [[Giant Man]] and the Immortals.
