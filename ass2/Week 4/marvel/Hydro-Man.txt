In this form, Hydro-Man and Sandman had limited intelligence and they did not have the ability to use their shape-shifting abilities as well as before. Although it was composed of the two aforementioned villains, it showed no indication of either villain\'s persona outside of an infatuation with Sadie Frickett, the current love interest of both villains. Soon after, a theater agent named Travis Rave proposed that Sadie and Mud-Thing be in a show, which Sadie gladly accepted at the prospect of stardom. Unfortunately, when the show proved to be a huge success, Sadie accidentally kissed Travis out of excitement, thereby enraging the jealous Mud-Thing. Mud-Thing ended up going on a rampage and carried Sadie with him to the top a sky-scraper. The creature was eventually defeated with a special gas that dried it out and caused it to crumble apart. Spider-Man managed to save Sadie from her plummet, but she ended up being genuinely upset over the loss of Mud-Thing, knowing that all it had ever done wrong was simply love her. After its defeat by Spider-Man and the police, Sandman and Hydro-Man separated from this form when the police were cleaning up Mud-Thing\'s remains.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #217–218.

While working with the Sinister Syndicate, Hydro-Man demonstrates a willingness to put up with just about anything in the name of financial gain. He ignores the constant politicking of the other members and looks past the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]]\'s betrayal of the group to the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] in the belief that the group was economically beneficial to him.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHydro-Man is able to bodily transform himself into a watery liquid substance; he can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease; when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. All of Hydro-Man\'s cells remain fully under his control when he is in his liquid state. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his liquid form. He can increase his mass and cause tidal waves and tsunamis. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe\'s grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. Through great mental exertion, Hydro-Man can also turn into steam. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams such as a fire hose, shaping parts of his body into \'solid-water\' constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects. \n\nThe Wizard enhanced his powers, through the use of sophisticated equipment.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #514-516</ref> These artificial enhancements granted him increased and more precise control over bodies of water and moisture near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in the [[Trapster]]\'s body.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #514</ref> His abilities were further augmented through the use of re-purposed super community technologies processed by [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] from the corrupt and deranged former CEO of the company, Walter Declun.<ref>\'\'Black Panther\'\' vol. 5 #11-12</ref> However, Spider-Man teamed up with Iceman and used Iceman\'s powers to solidify him into ice.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Hydro-Man claims that he has not aged since he gained his powers.<ref>\'\'Peter Parker: Spider-Man\'\' #51</ref> Hydro-Man possesses a certain degree of superhuman strength, and has been shown to be an exceptionally skilled fighter, and adept at using his powers for that purpose. \n\nIn some incarnations, depending on the writer, Hydro-Man can form his forearms into weapons such as Sandman does, except that Bench\'s weapons are made of water.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Bench has extensive experience in street-fighting techniques due to his experience as a criminal before his transformation. Though cunning, he has been consistently depicted by writers as a low tier henchman with little formal education and is often tricked into using his powers in ways that incapacitate him (as explained above). His normal attire consists of a black shirt and blue or green pants, as well as a costume invented by the Wizard.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Spider-Man: Reign===\nHydro-Man appears in \'\'[[Spider-Man: Reign]]\'\' as a member of the [[Sinister Six|Sinner Six]].

After being expelled from school, his parents enlisted him in the Navy to keep him out of trouble. While in the special research unit working as a crewman, he was knocked overboard into the ocean, whereupon his body was covered in a strange chemical that altered his cellular structure, allowing him to control any liquid at will and turn into water. Debuting in his self-titled episode, Hydro-Man attempts to win Watson back. As she repeatedly rejects his advances, he becomes more desperate and comes to see Spider-Man as a romantic rival. After robbing a museum and stashing its riches inside a water filtration plant, Hydro-Man kidnaps Watson and keeps her there as well. Upon discovering the plant, Spider-Man fights Hydro-Man until they end up on the rooftop, where the latter evaporates due to having no water sources nearby. A clone of Hydro-Man created by Professor [[Jackal (Marvel Comics character)|Miles Warren]] later appears in the two-part episode, "The Return of Hydro-Man", wherein the former kidnaps a water-based clone of Watson and battles Spider-Man inside Warren\'s underwater lab until both clones degenerate and evaporate.\n* Hydro-Man appears in the \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' episode "And the Wind Cries Medusa", voiced by [[Brad Garrett]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} This version is a member of the [[Frightful Four]].\n* Morris Bench appears in \'\'[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\' episode "Shear Strength", voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} This version is a demolition expert working for [[Norman Osborn]].\n* Hydro-Man appears in \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\', voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].<ref name="btva">{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Hydro-Man/|title=Voice Of Hydro Man – Marvel Universe - Behind The Voice Actors|website=Behind The Voice Actors|access-date=May 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511023756/https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Hydro-Man/|archive-date=May 11, 2019|postscript=.
