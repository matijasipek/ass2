One of the more interesting things [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]]], [[Jack Kirby]], and, of course, [[Steve Ditko]] did was combining the two different kinds of milieus: superhero and \'\'[[Dick Tracy]]\'\', with the unusual criminal characters who had some kind of physical deformity... Plus, Hammerhead—I liked [the] name, and John Romita came up with an interesting look".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #44| page= 7|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHammerhead\'s family immigrated from the [[Soviet Union]] to [[Italy]] when he was a child with help from a man known only as the General. His father ran a garage in Toirrano, where he insisted the young man speak only in Russian, beating him severely with a mallet when he would not. Although not much is known about his life before he became a criminal and supervillain, Hammerhead is known to be married and has a sister named Antonia.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man: Lifeline\'\' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAll the while, Hammerhead dreamed of becoming a gangster. He is eventually recruited into one of the "families" of the criminal organization known as the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] when a member oversees Hammerhead "making his bones" by murdering a childhood bully and his girlfriend in a theater showing \'\'[[The Godfather Part II]]\'\'. Originally a small-time hitman, Hammerhead quickly rises through the ranks of the Maggia, while pretending to be ethnically Italian so he can be "[[made man|made]]", or fully initiated member. In his final test, Hammerhead is brought to his father\'s garage (with the Maggia apparently unaware of their relationship). Hammerhead proceeds to kill his father, while saying Russian that he blames his father\'s abuse for making him a villain.<ref name="Extra #1">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man EXTRA!\'\' #1 (July 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOne day, Hammerhead was found beaten, disfigured, and delirious with pain in an alley in New York City\'s [[Bowery]] by [[Jonas Harrow]], a surgeon who had lost his medical license due to his illegal experiments. Seeing the opportunity both to save this man\'s life and to redeem his reputation, Harrow operated on the gunman for three days, replacing much of his shattered skull with a strong steel alloy.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 18 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> During the surgery, the unconscious thug fixated on the only memory he retained: an image of a poster for a movie called "The [[Al Capone]] Mob", which was hanging in the alley where he lay beaten and bloodied before Harrow found him. When he recovered, the memory of the poster and its images of 1930s-era gangsters prompted Hammerhead to start a gang of his own in the style of Capone and other mobsters of the 1920s. He even dressed as if he were living in that decade.\n\nA gang war broke out between Hammerhead\'s mob and [[Doctor Octopus]]\'s criminal organization. Hammerhead was forced to flee the country due to [[Spider-Man]]\'s interference.<ref>\'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #113-115. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later had a rematch with Doctor Octopus next to an atomic breeder reactor on a remote Canadian island which caused a chain reaction, blasting Hammerhead "out of phase" with this dimension.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #130-131. Marvel Comics.</ref> Some time later, he appeared as an immaterial ghost-like being to haunt Doctor Octopus. Doctor Octopus then unwittingly used a particle accelerator to restore Hammerhead to his corporeal form. Hammerhead kidnapped Spider-Man\'s [[Aunt May]], who was then rescued by Spider-Man as Doctor Octopus caused Hammerhead\'s helicopter to plummet into the Hudson River.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #157-159. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHammerhead then proposed that all Maggia families unite under his leadership. Wearing a strength-enhancing exoskeleton, he battled the [[Human Torch]], who then fused the exoskeleton\'s power pack.<ref>\'\'[[Fantastic Four]]\'\' #233. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hammerhead was nearly assassinated by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]\'s minion the Arranger during a gang war. Despite surviving the assassination, Hammerhead was ultimately forced out of a major role in New York City organized crime by the Kingpin.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #284-288. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHammerhead then allied himself with the [[Chameleon (Marvel Comics)|Chameleon]] in the latter\'s bid to become the new crime lord of New York City. The two served as partners in a splinter group of the Maggia.<ref>\'\'[[Web of Spider-Man]]\'\' #51. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hammerhead hired [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] as a bodyguard and hitman.<ref>\'\'Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #157.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHammerhead is a major player in underworld activities in the Marvel Universe and is highly sought after for elimination by the [[Punisher]].<ref>\'\'The Punisher\'\' vol. 3 #5 Marvel Comics.</ref> He becomes one of several gang warlords struggling to control the criminal underworld in the major cities of the Eastern United States.{{issue|date=November 2019}} During one of the first meetings of such warlords, Hammerhead was almost killed by the [[Fenris (comics)|Strucker twins]].{{issue|date=November 2019}} This meeting was being manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]], the head of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].{{issue|date=November 2019}} When [[Don Fortunato]] made a bid for control of the New York underworld, Hammerhead opposed him and was almost killed as a result.{{issue|date=November 2019}} When every other crime lord surrendered to Fortunato and his HYDRA allies, Hammerhead went rogue, launching a raid on Fortunato\'s home and successfully fighting off a HYDRA attack on his own headquarters. {{issue|date=November 2019}} He did have assistance from Spider-Man and [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Morbius the Living Vampire]], however.{{issue|date=November 2019}} For a time, the hero known as [[S.H.O.C.]] also assists Hammerhead.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man\'\' #79-80. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he was hired by [[Norman Osborn]] to be a part of the [[Sinister Twelve]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Knights: Spider-Man\'\' #10-11. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the events of the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]", Hammerhead used the vacuum left by the incarceration of the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] to gain a greater foothold in the ranks of organized crime, attempting to organize an army of costumed villains (consisting of the [[Ani-Men]] V, the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]] I, the Aura, [[Bloodshed (comics)|Bloodshed]], the [[Clown (comics)|Clown]], the [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]] III, the [[Discus (comics)|Discus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], the [[Great Gambonnos]], the [[Kangaroo (comics)|Kangaroo]] II, [[Man Mountain Marko]], the [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], [[Mindblast]], [[Gregory Herd|Override]], the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]], [[Stiletto (comics)|Stiletto]], the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], the [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]], [[Slyde]], the [[Trapster]], and the [[Will O\' The Wisp (comics)|Will O\' the Wisp]]) to enforce his new criminal empire. When Slyde balked at the idea, Hammerhead had [[Underworld (comics)|Underworld]] kill him to serve as a warning to anyone who did not join up with him. The Kingpin manipulated various hero factions, most notably [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Iron Man]], into breaking up Hammerhead\'s first convening of his army. During the conflict, Hammerhead was shot numerous times by Underworld, who was revealed to be working for the Kingpin. Underworld later confronted Hammerhead while he lay in prison and shot him at point-blank range with adamantium bullets.<ref>\'\'Civil War: War Crimes\'\' #1 (Feb. 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe bullets, while not penetrating his skull, did cause severe trauma to his brain, resulting him in needing surgery, but the hospital he was brought to was unable to treat him. In mid-surgery however, men working for the Kingpin\'s rival [[Mister Negative]] came in, killed the hospital staff, and took Hammerhead away. Mister Negative then has his surgeon Doctor Trauma revive Hammerhead and offers to transplant his brain into a new robotic adamantium skeleton, which Hammerhead agrees to.<ref name="Extra #1"/>\n\nThe operation is a complete success, and Hammerhead is restored to full mobility without any ill effects. He swears loyalty to Mister Negative in exchange for his restored life and proceeds to shape a gang of lowlife thugs into an effective army for his benefactor. He then proceeds to battle Spider-Man, besting him with no effort for the first time in years. Later, he has a rematch with Spider-Man, with Spider-Man dislocating Hammerhead\'s hip bone.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #575. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMister Negative sends Hammerhead to help Spider-Man (who Mister Negative corrupted) take down the Hood, who launches an attack on Negative\'s headquarters. He blackmails H.A.M.M.E.R. director [[Norman Osborn]] into forcing the Hood to pull out of Chinatown.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Mister Negative\'\' #2-3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHammerhead later begins to doubt his loyalty to Mister Negative when Silvermane, a deceased former Maggia don and an old enemy of the Kingpin, appears to return.{{issue|date=December 2015}} Unknown to Hammerhead, "Silvermane" is actually an android controlled by [[Mysterio]] to plant seeds of rebellion. Nevertheless, he flees a shootout with the Maggia when the Silvermane robot calls him a traitor. It is shown that Mister Negative had a computer chip put in Hammerhead\'s head to deliver an electroshock when necessary, which he promptly uses to punish him and remind him who is in charge.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\nDuring the \'\'Origin of the Species\'\' storyline, Hammerhead and Mister Negative are among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team, promising them that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items for him.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAlongside his nephew and minions, Hammerhead formed an alliance with the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], where he sided with her gang.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man\'\' vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHammerhead is among the crime lords competing with Mister Negative in obtaining the Tablet of Life and Destiny in order to win the favor of Mayor Wilson Fisk.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 5 #59. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nHammerhead has no superhuman abilities, yet his skull is now surgically reinforced with vibranium (or secondary adamantium), making his head flat on top; with this, he can charge and break through objects such as brick walls without causing any pain or damage to himself. This metal can absorb physical impacts that would otherwise fracture human bone. Hammerhead is in peak physical condition comparable to that of an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level athlete. He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant whose most dangerous tactic is charging head first like a bull toward an opponent. Hammerhead once utilized a strength-enhancing exoskeleton designed by the [[Tinkerer]].\n\nAfter an assassin\'s adamantium bullet penetrated a part of his head not protected by his adamantium skull, Hammerhead is surgically rebuilt by [[Mister Negative]]. Breakout surgeries replace the upper half of his skeleton with an adamantium endo-skeleton (the skeleton is shown to have a network of hydraulic servomechanisms). The upper portion of his body is now superhumanly strong as a result of the additional hidden cybernetic musculature, making him able to effortlessly beat a superpowered foe such as Spider-Man. Mister Negative does not use on Hammerhead the same [[Lord Dark Wind]] bonding process, used on the similarly empowered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Lady Deathstrike]] for coating their bones in adamantium: instead he replaces Hammerhead\'s bones with replicas fashioned in the invulnerable metal. It is still unknown how his artificial skeleton can carry on biological functions.\n\nThe intervention of Mr. Negative also radically changed Hammerhead\'s personality. Hammerhead now recalls his life as a Russian immigrant prior to the accident in which he adopted the 1920s gangster persona. Consequently, Hammerhead no longer speaks like a 1920s movie gangster, but instead behaves as a typical modern Russian mobster and hitman, as this was apparently his original personality prior to his head injury.\n\nHammerhead is highly skilled in the organization, concealment and management of criminal enterprises. He is an effective hitman, a skilled marksman (his preferred weapon was the [[Thompson submachine gun]]), and an excellent street fighter. In his original incarnation, Hammerhead was able to hold his own against Spider-Man despite being an ordinary human by using his superhumanly durable skull as a blunt instrument. After his recent augmentation, he is now capable of grappling with and physically overpowering Spider-Man to the extent that he could eventually crush his foe.\n\n==Other versions==\n===\'\'House of M\'\'===\nIn the \'\'[[House of M]]\'\' reality, Hammerhead is one of the gang leaders defeated by [[Luke Cage]] in his rise to power in Sapien Town.<ref>\'\'House of M: Avengers\'\' #1</ref>\n\n===\'\'Marvel Zombies\'\'===\nIn the \'\'[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]\'\' miniseries, Hammerhead briefly appears, along with the Owl and the Kingpin, at a meeting to discuss how to survive the zombie outbreak.

He kills [[Silvermane]] in the beginning of the [[Marvel Knights|Warriors]] story arc and becomes the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]]\' new leader and he burns down one of the Kingpin\'s warehouses. After an intense battle with [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], the [[Moon Knight]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Shang-Chi]], he was put in a coma when [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] brutally stabbed him in the chest with her [[Sai (weapon)|sai]] and flung him out of a window.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Spider-Man\'\' #79-85.

Additionally, he originally worked for Silvermane and was in a romantic relationship with his daughter, [[Silver Sable|Sable Manfredi]], before they broke up and Hammerhead became an enforcer for [[Tombstone (character)|Tombstone]]. Throughout the series, Hammerhead acts on Tombstone\'s behalf by manufacturing supervillains to distract Spider-Man from Tombstone\'s operations. However, Tombstone eventually becomes fed up with Hammerhead\'s failures and begins conducting business without him. While contacting [[Norman Osborn]] to create another supervillain, Hammerhead becomes inspired to betray his boss, unknowingly contributing to Osborn\'s plan to take Tombstone out of play. Secretly calling for a Valentine\'s Day summit between Tombstone, Silvermane, and [[Doctor Octopus]], Hammerhead attempts to manipulate the assembled crime bosses into killing each other. However, Spider-Man foils his plan by getting all of the bosses arrested, leading Tombstone to fire Hammerhead.\n* A [[Marvel Noir]]-inspired version of Hammerhead appears in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" [Pt. 3], voiced by [[Jon Polito]].<ref name="btva"/> This version is a crime boss, rival of [[Hulk|Joe Fixit]], and employed Martin Li as a henchman until Li becomes [[Mister Negative]].\n* Hammerhead appears in \'\'[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\', voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].<ref name="btva"/> This version is a crime boss who previously employed [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]] and [[Blizzard (Marvel Comics)|Randy Macklin]] and has a spoiled son named Tull (voiced by [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}) Debuting in the episode "Sandman", he inadvertently causes Marko\'s transformation into the titular character after burying him in toxic waste and sand after Marko failed him one too many times.
