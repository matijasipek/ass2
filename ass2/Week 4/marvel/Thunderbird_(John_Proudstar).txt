Since his death, the character has been temporarily brought back to life in the [[Necrosha]] and [[Chaos War]] storylines. His brother, [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]], known first as Thunderbird, and then as Warpath, is also a mutant and X-Men with similar capabilities.\n\nIn addition to his [[Marvel Universe|mainstream]] incarnations, Thunderbird has been depicted in other [[fictional universes]]. The most notable alternative version of the character is a member of the original [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] team. In other media, Thunderbird is one of the main characters adapted to the [[Live action|live-action]] television series \'\'[[The Gifted (American TV series)|The Gifted]]\'\', which debuted in 2017, portrayed by the actor [[Blair Redford]].\n\n==Publication history==\nWriter [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]] created Thunderbird for the new [[X-Men]], specifically to be a member of the team who would fail the entrance exam. Having already decided that the previously introduced characters [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] and [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] would fail the exam, Wein and Cockrum felt it would be unrealistic for only older characters to "flunk out", and set about creating a new character to fit this role. After developing Thunderbird, however, they decided that they liked the character — his costume in particular — too much to write him off after only one issue, and decided to keep him on.<ref name="TyphoonDave">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | pages = 50–52}}</ref>\n\nThe character debuted in \'\'[[Giant-Size X-Men]]\'\' #1 (May 1975). While working on the first issues of the regular series, the creative team realized that having Thunderbird as a regular character was problematic. According to Cockrum, "...we created him as an obnoxious loudmouth, and we already had an obnoxious loudmouth in [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. So one of us decided to kill him off after all, just for shock value."<ref name="TyphoonDave"/> [[Chris Claremont]], who scripted the story, confirms that it was Wein who decided to kill the character, and added, "He figured there are two ways to do this. One, you spend years, if not decades, building up a relationship between the audience and a character, building the emotional bonds between them so when something happens to that character the audience is devastated. Or you do it right off the bat, when no one is expecting it."<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Christensen | first1= William | last2 = Seifert | first2 = Mark | date = August 1993 | title = From Gofer to Comic Great | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | pages = 36–40}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Dave |last1=Richards |url=http://www.cbr.com/claremont-celebrates-the-past-with-x-men-gold/ |title=Claremont Celebrates the Past with "X-Men: Gold" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |website=cbr.com |date=November 20, 2013 |access-date=May 13, 2017}}</ref> The story culminating in Thunderbird\'s death appeared in \'\'[[X-Men]]\'\' #94-95.<ref>{{cite web|author=CBR Staff |url=http://www.cbr.com/taking-an-early-look-at-giant-size-x-men-4/ |title=Taking An Early Look at "Giant-Size X-Men" #4 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |website=cbr.com |date=June 9, 2005 |access-date=May 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, for the 25th anniversary of the introduction of Thunderbird, writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and artist [[Aaron Lopresti]] did a two-issue series about the character, with a cover by [[Art Adams]]. Marvel Comics never published the series. At the same period, after nine years of absence, Chris Claremont returned to the X-Men to take over the titles. According to [[Brian Cronin]] from [[Comic Book Resources]], there were likely two events that lead to the cancellation of this mini-series. Firstly, Claremont introduced a new X-Man character [[Thunderbird (Neal Shaara)|Neal Shaara]] with the codename Thunderbird.
