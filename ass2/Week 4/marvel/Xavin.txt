They were created by author [[Brian K.

Although Alphona was the series\' artist at the time, artist [[Takeshi Miyazawa]] first drew the character on print.

[[The Deans]] had been exiled from their planet Majesdane for criminal activities. They traveled to Earth where they encountered Xavin\'s father, Prince De\'zean of the Skrulls, who was going to rule the planet.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> The Deans had stopped the destruction but gave the Skrulls the location of another, more valuable planet: Majesdane.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> In order to prove they weren\'t lying, they gave Prince De\'zean\'s child their child\'s hand in marriage.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> The Deans had believed that Xavin would die in the new Skrull/Majesdanian war. Xavin later arrived on Earth in order to marry her and hopefully stop the fifteen-year war between their races.<ref name=" Vol2#8"/> Xavin encountered Karolina shortly after her romantic advances were rejected by [[Nico Minoru]].<ref name="firstappearance"/> Xavin, tried to convince Karolina to be their bride, fought and pursued her, in the form of a human male.<ref name="Vol2#8"/> Karolina revealed that she is not attracted to men and doesn\'t want to live a lie.

However, Xavin is still more-or-less an outcast to the other members. Like the other Runaways, Xavin is an orphan (they told the group when they first appeared that their parents were dead because of the aliens\' war). They also call themselves runaway when they reveal their identity to Geoffrey Wilder.<ref name="Vol2#18"/> Xavin joins the group but has trouble adjusting to their new surroundings and getting along with their new teammates, particularly Victor, whom they often offend with condescending remarks about robots. Although they are aggressive and headstrong, Xavin is motivated to protect their new home of their love for Karolina.<ref name="Vol2#19">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 2, #19.
