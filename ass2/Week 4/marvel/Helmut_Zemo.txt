Helmut was originally an engineer until he became enraged when reading a report about the return of Captain America and his father\'s death. Helmut would ultimately follow in his father\'s footsteps, using his family\'s money and his own scientific know-how to recreate his father\'s work.\n\nHelmut first surfaced under the alias of the \'\'\'Phoenix\'\'\', and captured [[Captain America]] to get revenge upon him for the death of his father. He was presumed deceased when he fell into a vat of boiling, specially-treated Adhesive X (a chemical created by his father Heinrich, which was a universal adhesive and was practically indissolvable<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=43}}</ref>). In a battle with Captain America, spilt Adhesive X permanently attached Heinrich\'s hood  his face, preventing him from ever removing it;<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #6</ref> in a dramatic echo, Helmut\'s face was hideously [[scar]]red by the boiling Adhesive X, giving his face the appearance of molten wax.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #168. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe resurfaced years later in the comics as Baron Zemo, first allied with [[Arnim Zola]]\'s [[mutation|mutates]]. He allied with [[Primus (Marvel Comics)#Primus I|Primus I]] and the half-rat/half human mutate Vermin, and kidnapped Captain America\'s childhood friend [[Arnold Roth (Captain America)|Arnold Roth]] in order to lure Captain America into a trap. He forced the Captain to battle hordes of mutates before revealing that he knew Captain America\'s secret identity.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #275-278. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nZemo later encountered [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Mother Superior]] and the [[Red Skull]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #290. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zemo underwent tutelage by Mother Superior and Red Skull, and then kidnapped Captain America\'s friend David Cox and brainwashed him to battle Captain America.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #293-294. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zemo then kidnapped Roth again, and directed a shared mental reenactment of Heinrich Zemo\'s last World War II encounter with Captain America.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #295-297. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zemo then battled Mother Superior, but was psychically overpowered.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #299. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMost notably, he formed a new incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]]. This fourth Masters of Evil was formed to strike at Captain America through the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]; they invaded and occupied [[Avengers Mansion]] and crippled [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the Avengers\' butler [[Edwin Jarvis]]. Zemo captured Captain America and the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]. Zemo battled Captain America, but fell off the mansion roof.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #273-277. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nZemo later hired [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]]\'s Brigade and psychic detective Tristram Micawber to help him locate the five fragments of the [[Bloodstone (comics)|Bloodstone]] in hopes of restoring his father to life. Fighting Captain America and [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]], Zemo\'s plan backfired, as he instead turned his father\'s corpse into a vessel for the demonic forces that lurk inside of the Bloodstone. The reanimated corpse was destroyed by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] (who sought to steal the Bloodstone for Red Skull) and a distraught Zemo fell down an inactive volcano in Japan trying to retrieve it.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #357-362. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nZemo survived the fall, though his right hand (which was not protected by a glove) was horrifically burnt and mangled. Driven insane by the destruction of his father\'s body, Helmut took control of an army of mutates and tried to re-enslave Vermin. He was defeated by [[Spider-Man]] and Vermin was freed.\n\nBroken and beaten, Zemo was taken in by a female scientist calling herself "The Baroness" who modeled herself after Heinrich. The two married and began kidnapping abused, neglected children to serve as their children. Zemo\'s sanity returned and he even created a new realistic face mask to hide his disfigured face from his adopted children, whom he nurtured and swore to protect from those who might return them to their abusive foster homes. The couple\'s peaceful life was ultimately shattered when Captain America discovered their home, while searching for the evil super-scientist [[Superia]]. Superia and the Baroness (who revealed that she had pretended to be Heinrich Zemo reborn in a clone body during a fight with [[Silver Sable]] and Spider-Man) mocked Helmut and his newfound domestic househusband status as they plotted to kill him. Zemo turned on his wife and Superia, before turning his attention to dropping Captain America into a vat of Adhesive X. The plan failed and Zemo (now wearing his trademark hood) fell into the container instead, with the Baroness (hoping to curry favor with her husband), falling in after him. The two were rescued by Captain America and Helmut bemoaned that like his father, his face now was permanently hidden by his mask. Captain America responded by revealing that the Avengers had since found a way to dissolve Adhesive X and would use it to free Zemo from his costume and hood, a fact that drove him further into a rage due to Captain America never offering to share this [[adhesive remover]] with his father.\n\n[[File:Helmut as Citizen V.jpg|thumb|right|145px|Helmut Zemo as Citizen V. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]\nZemo ultimately escaped prison, though his wife the Baroness died shortly after being sentenced to prison for her role in the abduction of the children they were raising. During this time, Zemo discovered that [[Erik Josten|Goliath]] was imprisoned in the Microverse and formed a new version of Masters of Evil to free Goliath. But after rescuing Goliath, the Avengers and The [[Fantastic Four]] disappeared during the [[Onslaught (Marvel Comics)|Onslaught]] crisis and were presumed dead. After overhearing the [[Abe Jenkins|Beetle]] (Abe Jenkins) and Goliath talk about who would replace the Avengers and The Fantastic Four, a distraught Zemo soon found a new purpose for his team: the Masters of Evil would take on new heroic identities as the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zemo would lead the group under the alias \'\'\'[[Citizen V]]\'\'\' (a twist of irony as Heinrich Zemo had killed the original Citizen V during World War II) and planned to have the Thunderbolts gain the world\'s trust in order to conquer it.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' Annual 1997. Marvel Comics.</ref> The public took a liking to the team much more quickly than Zemo, or any of the other Thunderbolts, expected and soon most of them came to like the feeling of being heroes.\n\nWhen the missing heroes returned, Zemo had the Thunderbolts\' true identities leaked, forcing them to flee with him into deep space to assist his plan to conquer the world through mind control.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #10-11. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, most of the Thunderbolts rebelled and with the assistance of [[Iron Man]] foiled Zemo\'s plan.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #11-12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zemo went into hiding and plotted revenge on his former teammates (who were trying to win back the public\'s trust by being true heroes).<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> After another of Zemo\'s plans was foiled by Captain America and a new Citizen V ([[Dallas Riordan]]),<ref>\'\'Captain America/Citizen V \'98\'\'. Marvel Comics.</ref> Helmut was killed by the new [[Scourge of the Underworld]],<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #39. Marvel Comics.</ref> though his mind was transferred via bio-modem technology into the comatose body of [[Citizen V|John Watkins III]].{{issue|date=June 2013}} Now in possession of Watkins\' body, Zemo again played the Citizen V role, this time as a member of the V-Battalion,<ref>\'\'Citizen V and the V-Battalion\'\' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref> until the Thunderbolts\' final battle with [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], during which his consciousness was removed from Watkins\' body and transferred, in [[electronics|electronic]] form, into his ally [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]]\'s mechanical "tech-pack". {{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nOn the artificial world Counter-Earth - the same world to which the Avengers and The Fantastic Four had previously vanished - the Thunderbolts encountered Zemo\'s counterpart, \'\'\'Iron Cross\'\'\', in that world.{{issue|date=June 2013}} Fixer transferred Zemo\'s mind into his double\'s unmutilated body. {{issue|date=June 2013}} Zemo then took up leadership of the Thunderbolts who were on Counter-Earth;{{issue|date=June 2013}} when this group was reunited with their teammates who had remained on the normal [[Marvel Universe]] Earth, {{issue|date=June 2013}} [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] briefly resumed leadership,{{issue|date=June 2013}} but then left the team to return to the Avengers.{{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nFor a while Zemo remained the leader of the Thunderbolts.{{issue|date=June 2013}} In 2004\'s "Avengers/Thunderbolts" limited series, he attempted to take over the world again  this time with the belief that he could save the world by taking it over.{{issue|date=June 2013}} Zemo now seems to be motivated by a twisted altruism rather than his original selfish desires; he feels he has grown beyond his father in that regard. {{issue|date=June 2013}} However, the Avengers foiled his scheme, his teammate [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] went berserk, Zemo\'s new body was blasted while he attempted to protect Captain America, and he left the team and went into hiding after obtaining Moonstone\'s twin alien gems, two artifacts of great power. {{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nZemo had been manipulating the United States government, the New Thunderbolts, the [[Purple Man]], the [[Squadron Sinister]], and a host of other relatively obscure Marvel characters. {{issue|date=June 2013}} His goals are unknown, but he is clearly still motivated by a desire to save the world by taking it over, or at least manipulating it towards what he perceives as a beneficial future. Zemo has also, apparently through trial and error, learned how to use the power of the moonstones in various ways, from simply generating raw energy, to transporting himself and others through time, space, and dimensions, to viewing possible future events through dimensional riftsand, apparently, to repair his damaged face (or, at least to create the illusion that it was undamaged).{{issue|date=June 2013}} He has also recruited members of both his original and subsequent incarnations of the Thunderbolts to his cause, as well as eventually bringing the current team of Thunderbolts around to joining him. {{issue|date=June 2013}} The group resides in what Zemo calls his "Folding Castle", a structure that he has connected to various other places around the world by dimensional portals.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nAs a result of The \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' storyline, [[Iron Man]] asked Zemo to begin recruiting villains to his cause, which Zemo had already been doing, unknown to Iron Man.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, he met up with Captain America and informed him that he really had reformed. He showed Captain America his face, once again scarred, to remind him of his earlier sacrifice, and gave him a key that would allow him to escape from the super-human prison being constructed if Captain America would allow his Thunderbolts to fight the Squadron Sinister.{{issue|date=June 2013}} He also gave Captain America all his old mementos, destroyed by Zemo in \'Avengers Under Siege\', which he had gone back in time and rescued with the help of the Moonstones. Finally, Captain America agreed.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nZemo, was always told as a child that he was superior, he now believes his father\'s Nazi ideals to be untrue, and that the only way to become superior is through righteousness. After helping Captain America, he remarked to his father\'s portrait that the man would be displeased with today\'s good deeds. Zemoonce again wearing his unscarred facethen revealed that [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] was going to betray him and he was going to sacrifice himself in their upcoming battle with the Squadron Sinister. He told her that he would not die, but that he would become superior through his sacrifice "by living forever".{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nZemo revealed his true nature when he saved the Wellspring of Power from the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] planning to use it for his own ends. Believing that all of his visions were subject to the flow of time, and that nothing was set in stone, Zemo defeated the Grandmaster, and boasted to his teammates that the power was now all hisand theirs. He insisted that he would use it to help the world, despite the consequences of doing so. Songbird, having temporarily lost her own powers during the final battle, was told by Zemo "...now is when your betrayal would have come". However, the vision of Songbird\'s betrayal turned out to be true after all. Using a simple opera note to crack the moonstones, Songbird sent Zemo into a whirlwind of cosmic space/time. Just before he was completely sucked into the vacuum, he screamed out that he "would never have hurt a world he worked so hard to save".{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe limited series \'\'Thunderbolts Presents: Zemo - Born Better\'\' (2007), written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and drawn by [[Tom Grummett]], explores the history of the [[Zemo barony]]. Helmut, sucked into the vacuum, wakes up in medieval Germany (1503), witnessing Harbin Zemo\'s death and his succession, while in the present academic Wendell Volker and [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] deduce that Helmut has traveled in time. Captured and taken prisoner as a [[leprosy|leper]], Helmut manages to inspire Harbin\'s twelve-year-old grandson Heller Zemo to kill his own father Hademar Zemo and fulfill his destiny as the third (and most enlightened and progressive) Baron Zemo. Heller goes to the hidden cell to free his "muse", discovering that Helmut has somehow disappeared. Helmut makes a jump to 1556 where he fights alongside Heller\'s son Herbert Zemo, then later jumps to 1640 where he slays Herbert\'s son Helmuth Zemo, and later arrives in 1710 where he narrowly escapes being killed by Helmuth\'s son Hackett Zemo.{{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nMeanwhile, in the present, Volker reveals that the Zemo bloodline is not just limited to Helmut\'s immediate family. In fact Harbin\'s descendants are spread out all over the world. Wendell visits Miss Klein, a descendant of a bastard child of Hilliard Zemo, the eighth Baron Zemo and Jewish lover Elsbeth Kleinenshvitz. Hilliard becomes baron after the death of his father Hartwig Zemo in the [[Seven Years\' War]]. In the past Helmut sees Hilliard and Elsbeth in love, realizing that the residual energy of the Moonstone is drawing him into the present, but forcing him to stop and live every key moment of Zemo\'s lineage. Helmut manages to save Elsbeth, who is sentenced to die by the Diet because of her Jewish ancestry and her wealthy family, but in the present Volker kills her distant descendant, convinced that his actions can pull Helmut to his proper place in the time stream. {{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nHelmut next ends up in 1879 where he stays for several weeks working his way up to be part of the travelling guard of Hobart Zemo, the tenth Baron Zemo. Hobart is killed during a civilian uprising shortly after German Emperor William passes legislation to curb the Socialist party. Helmut jumps forward in time before he can save his own great-grandfather. Helmut arrives during World War I in a battle between British forces led by the original [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] and German forces led by his own grandfather Baron Herman Zemo, the eleventh Baron Zemo. Helmut witnesses Herman\'s men slaughter the majority of the British forces with mustard gas. Later, Helmut goes with Herman and his men to find Castle Zemo reduced to rubble by the war. Helmut travels forward in time again to his father\'s tenure as a Nazi during World War II. {{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nBack in the present, Volker discovers that Castle Zemo has been restored in the present. Wendell tours the castle with a local German police man and Interpol agent Herr Fleischtung, Wendell murders both men. Wendell has apparently murdered several Zemo relations in the belief that this spilling of Zemo blood would bring Helmut back to the present.{{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nAfter battling his own father in the past, giving him the inspiration to take up the Zemo mantle, Helmut returns to the present and manages to convince Wendell not to kill him as well, instead taking what is discovered to be his cousin under his wing, as he sets out to do something new for the world. {{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nFollowing the events of The [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] crossover as seen in the \'\'[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]\'\' storyline, [[Luke Cage]] assumes control over the Thunderbolts and has Fixer impersonate Zemo as a test to see which of his new teammates would betray the team if offered a chance to escape.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts #144-145</ref> Later on, it was revealed that Fixer was keeping in secret contact with Zemo while working on the Raft.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #606. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the \'\'Fear Itself\'\' event, Zemo gave Fixer key info on the mutant army threatening Chicago.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nHaving spent his time on the sidelines, watching [[Norman Osborn]]\'s rise to power with the intent of waiting to see what Norman would do with control over the Thunderbolts and later [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Zemo reappeared following the events of the Siege when Osborn was ultimately defeated by The Avengers. A chance encounter at the Thunderbolts\' former base in Colorado with the [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] led to him learning [[Bucky Barnes]] was the current iteration of Captain America. Zemo confronted his rival and discovered how the man had survived his father\'s death trap only to become the Winter Soldier, a trained Soviet assassin who killed scores of people for several Russian handlers. But most alarming was the fact that Zemo discovered the original Captain America had not only forgiven his successor for the crimes, but had actively covered them up even after Winter Soldier blew up a huge chunk of New York, killing several dozen S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in order to restore power to a [[Cosmic Cube]] fragment.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #608. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nZemo recruited Jurgen "Iron-Handed" Hauptmann (of Red Skull\'s Exiles), as well as Fixer and a [[Janice Lincoln|new female version]] of Beetle to expose the current Captain America\'s sins to the world. This included drugging Bucky with nanites that caused Captain America to behave irrationally and attack police officers and leaking to the media, not only detailed files revealing Winter Soldier\'s acts of terrorism committed as a mind-controlled pawn of the Russians, but video footage as well of him being trained by handlers. Zemo ultimately kidnapped Bucky and took his father\'s victim to Heinrich\'s island which is where Bucky\'s original "death" occurred. There Zemo confessed that he did what he did, not out of a desire to finish the job his father started, but out of jealousy over how Captain America and his allies quickly forgave Bucky for his crimes, yet continue to scorn the reformed Helmut who had saved the world on numerous occasions.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #608-612. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zemo then forced Bucky into a similar deathtrap as the one his father put Bucky in, modified though in order to allow Bucky a chance to escape. Zemo then escaped from the island unharmed.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #609-612. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nZemo has since turned his eye towards [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], who he blames for usurping control over the Thunderbolts from him. Zemo makes a deal with Hawkeye\'s former mentor [[Trick Shot (comics)|Trick Shot]] (whose cancer had returned) to train Zemo\'s mystery acquaintance to become a master archer in exchange for medical care. When the training was complete, Zemo reneged on the deal. Trick Shot (on the brink of death) was delivered to [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] to serve as a message to Hawkeye. Before he died in his former pupil\'s arms, Trick Shot warns Hawkeye of the threat he will soon face.<ref>\'\'Hawkeye: Blindspot\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the pages of \'\'[[Avengers Undercover]]\'\', Zemo has become the new leader of The [[Shadow Council]]\'s Masters of Evil following the death of [[Max Fury]].<ref>\'\'Avengers Undercover\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nZemo later becomes the new leader of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] and enters into conflict with [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], the new Captain America.<ref>\'\'All-New Captain America\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Using the toxic blood of an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] boy named Lucas, Zemo plans to sterilize the human race and distribute a cure to only a small portion of those infected, thus forcibly solving the planet\'s problems with overpopulation and lack of resources. He later kills Ian Rogers, the new [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] and Captain America\'s partner, by slashing his throat and sends a photo to Steve Rogers.<ref>\'\'All-New Captain America\'\' #2</ref> He later fights Wilson to a standstill until Lucas escapes via jet plane to spread his blood in the world.<ref>\'\'All-New Captain America\'\' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Avengers: Standoff!]]\'\' storyline, Zemo appears as a prisoner of the S.H.I.E.L.D. established [[gated community]] called Pleasant Hill where the technology Kobik that was derived from the Cosmic Cube turned him into an amnesiac man named Jim who later discovered that Pleasant Hill is surrounded by a forcefield. He briefly witnessed an eerie girl bring a bird back to life until she is taken away by some adults. Then he encounters a mechanic named Phil who arranges a meet-up following his arson activity. On Day 40, Jim met Phil who had created a device that enabled people to return to their true selves. Phil also stole a training video where Mayor [[Maria Hill]] gave a video tour of Pleasant Hill describing to the S.H.I.E.L.D. cadets watching this to be the future of supervillain incarceration where they are turned into mild-mannered civilians using reality-warping technology derived from the Cosmic Cube called "Kobik". A demonstration was shown when Graviton was turned into a Pleasant Hill inhabitant named Howie Howardson. As Phil uses the device on himself and Jim to restore their true selves, Jim was restored back to Zemo while Phil was Fixer once again. Both of them vow to use the device on the other brainwashed supervillain prisoners and reduce Pleasant Hill to dust.<ref>\'\'Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Zemo and Fixer started working on restoring the memories of the inmates one by one. Then Zemo led a coordinated assault on a S.H.I.E.L.D. outpost that serves as the Pleasant Hill City Hall.<ref>\'\'Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After [[Kraven the Hunter]] captures Kobik, he loads her into Fixer\'s machine where Baron Zemo plans to control Kobik. During the Avengers\' fight with Baron Zemo\'s villain allies, both Zemo and [[Erik Selvig]] tried to get Kobik to come with them. Kobik ended up teleporting Zemo and Selvig away from Pleasant Hill. They were last seen in the Himalayas trying to make their way back to civilization. Zemo brings Selvig with him as he\'s crucial to his next plan.<ref>\'\'Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter leaving the Himalayas, Zemo begins to form his "New Masters" group, he starts by recruiting [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Firebrand]], [[Flying Tiger (Marvel Comics)|Flying Tiger]], and [[Plantman]] II. They later encounter Steve Rogers, the original Captain America, [[Free Spirit (comics)|Free Spirit]] and [[Jack Flag]]. Zemo then tries to escape with Doctor Selvig until Captain America enters his plane. Before he could kill Steve Rogers, Zemo is defeated by Jack Flag.<ref>\'\'Captain America: Steve Rogers\'\' #1.

In the confrontation, Zemo hints to Rogers that he wants to "see an empire fall", which leads Rogers, Wilson and Barnes to believe Zemo intends to awaken five sleeping Winter Soldiers at a Siberian Hydra base and use them to take over the world. Once Zemo, Rogers, Barnes, and Stark reach the base however, they learn Zemo killed the Winter Soldiers and shows them an old security tape that reveals Barnes was responsible for murdering Stark\'s parents years ago, which Rogers kept from Stark.
