In 2003 Marvel Comics launched \'\'[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]\'\', a new take on the Squadron Supreme universe, where Hyperion is raised by the United States government to be a super-powered operative.

In the 12-issue \'\'Squadron Supreme\'\' limited series (Sept. 1985-Aug. 1986) [[Mark Gruenwald]] picked up from where Earth-712 was last seen in \'\'The Defenders\'\' #114 and revealed this Hyperion\'s origins.\n\nThe character is re-imagined for Marvel\'s [[Marvel MAX|MAX]] imprint title \'\'[[Squadron Supreme (Supreme Power)|Supreme Power]]\'\', where he is an alien who has been raised by the government.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=316}}</ref> This iteration received a spinoff miniseries, \'\'Supreme Power: Hyperion\'\', which showed a dystopian possible future.\n\nAnother Hyperion joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in [[Jonathan Hickman]]\'s \'\'The Avengers\'\' vol. 5 #1 (Dec. 2012). Hickman described the decision to use a new Hyperion, rather than an existing one:\n\n<blockquote>This is yet another parallel universe Hyperion. This is not King Hyperion, or Supreme Power Hyperion, this is not Gruenwald\'s Hyperion. This is Hyperion without all that baggage. This is Hyperion with a fresh slate, for a very specific purpose.
