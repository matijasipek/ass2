The character was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Phil Jimenez]], and first appeared in "Swing Shift", a story in \'\'Free Comic Book Day: The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #1 (May 2007). The name "Mister Negative" is a reference to [[photographic negative]], as the colors of his skin, hair, and costume are inverted when he transforms into his alter ego.\n\nOriginally a [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese gangster]] and [[Snakehead (gang)|human trafficker]], whose real name was never revealed,{{efn|"Martin Li" is the name of a slave who died when the \'\'Golden Mountain\'\', the ship Mr. Negative was working on at the time, crashed onto the [[New York City|New York]] shores.

The experiment gave the character control over both the [[Darkforce]] and [[Lightforce (energy)|Lightforce]], and led to the creation of two polar opposite personalities: \'\'\'Mister Positive\'\'\', posing as a benevolent and kind [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] named \'\'\'Martin Li\'\'\', who would go on to found the F.E.A.S.T. Project as a means to help homeless people; and the ruthless crime lord Mister Negative, who leads the Inner Demons gang in an attempt to take over New York\'s criminal underworld. Originally, the character was depicted as suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]], with one personality not maintaining the other\'s memories, but both personas were later shown to be fully aware of each other\'s existence. As Mister Negative, his powers include healing, mind-controlling others through "corruption", and charging regular weapons with his energy.\n\nSince his conception, the character has been adapted into several forms of media outside of comics, including animated series and video games.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Phil Jimenez]], Mister Negative first appeared in "Swing Shift", a story in \'\'Free Comic Book Day: The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #1 (2007), which was set in the immediate aftermath of the "[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]" storyline. Mister Negative then appeared in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #546 (Jan. 2008), the first issue of the follow-up storyline "[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]".\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMartin Li is introduced with the backstory of an illegal Chinese immigrant from [[Fujian]] province who attempted to travel to America to be with his wife. His mode of transportation, the \'\'Golden Mountain\'\', was a slave ship operated by the Snakehead gang as a way to sell Fujian captives as overseas slaves in [[Kenya]]. During a storm, the ship\'s crew evacuated, leaving the captives alone to make a break for the New York shores. Li was the only survivor and spent the following years building a large fortune and dedicating himself to helping those less fortunate.<ref name="DR:MN#1">{{Cite comic |writer=[[Van Lente, Fred]] |penciller=Gugliotta, Gianluca |inker=[[Lanning, Andy]] |colorist=Pattison, Ronda, Mossa, Andres |letterer=Lanphear, Dave |editor=Wacker, Stephen |story=The Last Stand of Mr. Negative |title=Dark Reign: Mister Negative |volume= |issue=#1 |date=Aug. 2009 |publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] |location=New York|page=}}</ref>\n\nThe story is later revealed to be somewhat false, though only the Mister Negative persona appears aware of it.

This gang member was eventually captured by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] Don [[Silvermane]] and experimented on with a synthetic drug created by Maggia chemist [[Simon Marshall (comics)|Simon Marshall]] that could be more potent than heroin. He escaped with the help of two other experimental [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|inmates]] and soon developed two personalities, the kind-hearted Martin Li and the villainous Mister Negative, the latter of the two developing the ability to generate a [[Darkforce|black electrical energy]] that could be used to heal, control others, or charge objects with his touch.

A corrupted person\'s clothes change his colors to his photographic negatives, and all who are corrupted praise their new master with proclamations like "Mr. Negative was never born, so he is ever living", or "He is attached to nothing, thus he is one with all."<ref name="DR:MN#1"/> The effectiveness of his corruption varies depending on how good the affected person was before their conversion: White Dragon, a villain himself, gained vastly increased stamina and endurance, but was still easily dispatched (his clothes reverted to normal once he was killed). Conversely, Spider-Man, a hero in every respect, was corrupted into a spiteful and angry villain, despising every value he held dear (even his [[Uncle Ben]]\'s memory) and no more above killing.<ref name="DR:MN#2"/> Spider-Man is able to break the hold his malevolent side has over him when he is on the verge of killing [[Betty Brant]], as he remembers the love he once had for her upon getting close. Mr. Negative\'s corrupting touch appears to be ineffective against beings with supernatural powers, as Hood is unaffected when Negative attempts to corrupt him; Mr. Negative claims that this is because the Hood\'s soul belongs to [[Dormammu]], a being even darker than he is.<ref name="DR:MN#3"/> It has since been revealed that while Negative can renew his influence on others, he cannot corrupt someone once that individual has broken free of his influence already, allowing Peter Parker to infiltrate his plan by using the fact that he had been corrupted by Negative as Spider-Man without his foe knowing his secret identity.<ref name="asm4-7"/>\n\nMr. Negative\'s alternate Martin Li persona seems to have the power to cure others: in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #568, a simple touch from Li completely cures Eddie Brock of his cancer, and combines the remnants of the Venom symbiote in his blood with his white blood cells, creating a new symbiote named [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]] that possesses similar healing powers. Aside from this, homeless people who have stayed at Martin Li\'s shelter have rapidly recovered from any illnesses or injuries they suffered from. It is possible that his healing touch is supposed to be the opposite of Mr. Negative\'s corrupting touch. It is revealed that Anti-Venom can be affected by Mr. Negative\'s energy because it negates his healing ability.\n\nMr. Negative also has access to advanced technology and secret laboratories, in which he is able to give his subjects medical care far more advanced than that available to the general public.<ref name="Extra1"/>\n\nIn the 2018 \'\'[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]\'\' game, Mr. Negative also possesses the ability to project powerful electricity-like blasts of negative energy from his hands.\n\n===Inner Demons===\nMister Negative is often accompanied by several [[Henchmen#In popular culture|henchmen]], known as his Inner Demons,<ref name="ASM547"/> who wear Chinese opera masks and use [[high tech]] electrified versions of swords, knuckles and various other Asian weaponry such as [[Gun (staff)|gun staffs]] and [[nunchaku]]s. They are able to regenerate from even the most lethal wounds within a matter of seconds, as they have been shown almost immediately recovering from impalement, gunshots to the head, and even getting torn apart or decapitated. It has been implied that the Inner Demons can be killed under the right circumstances: at one point, Anti-Venom claims to have killed some of them, possibly by suffocation, which he later notes to be an effective tactic against them.<ref name="Extra2"/> Mr. Negative also orders the murder of two Inner Demons who have failed him.{{issue|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===Infinity Warps===\nIn Warp World, a world folded in half during the \'\'[[Infinity Wars]]\'\' event, Dagger Li (a combination of Dagger and Martin Li) is a member of the occult paramilitary group named the [[Midnight Sons|Midnight Guns]]. They were attacked in their base in Salem by Weapon Hex (a combination of [[X-23]] and [[Scarlet Witch]]) and Hellhound (a combination of [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Magik]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]]) on behalf of Herbert Wyndham to steal the Storm Sigil from team-member Hellfire (combination of [[Punisher]] and [[Daimon Hellstrom]]). The two attackers made quick work of the Midnight Guns and left no survivors.<ref>\'\'Infinity Wars: Weapon Hex\'\' #1.

This version of Martin Li is a henchman for [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] before he acquires the power to petrify targets from a [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] shard. After hearing the "prime" [[Spider-Man]] call [[Spider-Man Noir]] "Mister Negative", Li takes the name for himself and uses his abilities on his boss, [[Miles Morales|Kid Arachnid]], and [[Hulk|Joe Fixit]]\'s gang before turning Hammerhead\'s remaining gang members to his side. Li attempts to use his abilities on all of New York City, but is ultimately defeated by the Spider-Men and Fixit, who strip him of his powers and restore everyone he petrified to normal.\n* Mister Negative appears in the \'\'[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\' episode "Brand New Day", voiced by [[Eric Bauza]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Brand New Day|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=45|airdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Mister Negative appears as a playable character in \'\'[[Marvel Strike Force]]\'\'. \n* Mister Negative appears as a playable character in \'\'[[Marvel Contest of Champions]]\'\'.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n* Mister Negative appears as a playable character in \'\'[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]\'\', via the \'\'[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]\'\' [[Downloadable content|DLC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/pick-up-the-lego-marvel-super-heroes-2-cloak-dagger-dlc-pack-now |title=Pick Up the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 \'Cloak & Dagger\' DLC Pack Now |last=Dinh |first=Christine |date=March 20, 2018|publisher=Marvel Comics |access-date=March 24, 2018 }}</ref>\n* Mister Negative appears as a boss in the 2018 \'\'[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]\'\' video game, voiced by [[Stephen Oyoung]].<ref>{{cite tweet |last=Penagos |first=Ryan |user=AgentM |number=1020050898758725632 |date=July 19, 2018 |title=Stephen Oyoung & Nicole Elise are on the #SpiderManPS4 cast!

As Mister Negative, he is the ruthless leader of a gang called the Inner Demons, some of whom possess a portion of his powers, who seeks to conquer the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]\'s territory following the crime boss\' defeat at [[Peter Parker (Insomniac Games character)|Spider-Man]]\'s hands. Li also seeks revenge against Mayor [[Norman Osborn]] for using him as a test subject for the Devil\'s Breath virus in his youth, which granted him his powers but traumatized him after he lost control of them and accidentally killed his parents. Though Spider-Man foils Li\'s initial attempt to exact revenge and the latter is imprisoned at the [[Raft (comics)|Raft]], he is soon broken out by [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] and joins his [[Sinister Six]] to help him exact revenge on Osborn as well as steal the antidote for the Devil\'s Breath after Octavius releases the virus upon New York. However, Negative is defeated a second time by Spider-Man and subsequently knocked aside by Octavius, who deems him useless before escaping with Osborn and the antidote.\n\n== Collected editions ==\n{| class="wikitable"\n|+\n!Title\n!Material Collected\n!Published Date\n!ISBN\n|-\n|\'\'Dark Reign: The Underside\'\'\n|\'\'Dark Reign: Mister Negative\'\' #1-3 and \'\'Dark Reign: Lethal Legion\'\' #1-3, \'\'Dark Reign: Zodiac\'\' #1-3, \'\'Dark Reign: Made Men\'\' \n|December 23, 2009\n|{{ISBNT|978-0785141600}}\n|-\n|\'\'Dark Reign: Mister Negative\'\'\n|\'\'Dark Reign: Mister Negative\'\' #1-3\n|March 25, 2010\n|{{ISBNT|978-0785141648}}\n|-\n|\'\'Spider-Man: Brand New Day ‚Äî The Complete Collection Vol. 4\'\'\n|\'\'Dark Reign: Mister Negative\'\' #1-3 and \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #592-601 and \'\'Annual\'\' #36, \'\'Spider-Man: The Short Halloween\'\', \'\'Amazing Spider-Man: American Son Sketchbook\'\' and material from \'\'Amazing Spider-Man Family\'\' #7\n|December 20, 2017\n|{{ISBNT|978-1302907990}}\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=12413|title=Mr. Negative}}\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mister-negative/4005-49969/ Mister Negative] at Comic Vine\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-inner-demons/4060-56281/ Inner Demons] at Comic Vine\n* {{Marveldatabase}}\n\n{{Cloak and Dagger}}\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Sinister Six}}\n{{Punisher}}\n\n[[Category:Villains in animated television series]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Slott]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with healing abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with dissociative identity disorder]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fictional gangsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional terrorists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Fictional Chinese people]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Triad (organized crime)]]'}]}}}}
