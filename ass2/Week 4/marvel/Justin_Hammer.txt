In the event that a mercenary under his employ violated his contract, Hammer would send an enforcement unit (usually led by his most reliable supervillain employee [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]]) to attack the rogue and confiscate his assigned equipment.\n\nAt the start of the \'\'[[Demon in a Bottle]]\'\' storyline, Hammer invented a device called the Hypersonic Scan Transmitter which allowed him to take control of Iron Man\'s armor.

In a final confrontation with Iron Man on Hammer\'s own space station, Hammer was accidentally frozen in a block of ice when the water he fell into leaked out into space and instantly froze and is currently lost in space.
