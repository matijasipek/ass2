He spent a few months floating through the cosmos as radio waves and energy. Eventually his signal was picked up by an outlying group of [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] who were attempting to contact the Technarchy. Fascinated by what he found, Ultron decided that the Phalanx lacked direction from a singular consciousness, and that he would be perfect for the role. Through sheer force of will, he merged himself with the Phalanx\'s programming. In turn, the Phalanx viewed Ultron as the sympathetic father they had yearned for. Under Ultron\'s guidance, the Phalanx began the \'\'[[Annihilation: Conquest]]\'\' with invasions that started with the [[Kree]] space. Later by taking control of [[Adam Warlock]]\'s body, Ultron hopes to achieve "true techno-organic perfection" but is eventually forced to abandon Adam\'s body by the Technarchy [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] and is later destroyed in combat by [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]] and [[Phyla-Vell|Quasar]].<ref>\'\'Annihilation: Conquest\'\' #1â6 (August 2007 â May 2008: bi-monthly).

In the present, the Quinjet crash lands on [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], freeing Ultron. By hijacking the [[ISAAC (comics)|ISAAC]] computer, he transforms Titan into Planet Ultron, and launches a plan to infect the entire universe with a [[nanite]] virus that transforms organic creatures into Ultron Sentries. The ensuing confrontation with the Avengers leads to Ultron inadvertently merging with his maker, transforming into a human/machine hybrid. The resulting fusion played on Pym\'s self-loathing of his own human weakness causes an acceptance of this new state. Ultron is defeated when [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]]\'s powers force love onto himself, causing the part of that is now Pym to accept his old weakness and flaws while the villain has a mental breakdown and flees into space.<ref>\'\'Avengers: Rage of Ultron\'\'.

Upon being alerted to the approach of [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]]\'s task force by a robot version of Edwin Jarvis, Ultron decides to give his "family" a warm welcome.<ref>\'\'Secret Empire\'\' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Tony Stark A.I.\'s team and Captain America\'s team confront each other, they are captured by Ultron who forces both teams to sit at a dinner table. Ultron argues that he is doing this because the Avengers have become less of a family over the years as so many of them jump to obey Captain America or Iron Man despite past experience confirming that this should be a bad idea, but the Stark A.I. counters that the only reason the team failed as a family was because of Pym\'s attack on Wasp. Outraged, Ultron nearly attacks the other heroes, but [[Scott Lang]] is able to talk him down by arguing that Pym remains his own inspiration. Ultron allows the Stark A.I.\'s team to leave with the fragment, arguing that he will leave Captain America\'s plans with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] alone as it appears to be the best chance for world peace.<ref>\'\'Secret Empire\'\' #4.

In addition, he starts to call this form "Ultron Pym". After testing it on some people and some experiments on Wonder Man and Vision, Ultron Pym plans to make a fusion of Jocasta and Wasp.

The person who merged with it has died and that the robot can only simulate their personality. In other words, his maker was killed when accidentally merging with Ultron. Learning about this and not wanting to risk proving Iron Man\'s point by having the atomic separator used on him, Ultron surrenders to Iron Man, knowing that Pym is dead. When the Avengers arrive, they restrain Ultron in a Vibranium casket reinforced with Asgardian magic until they can find a permanent place to have Ultron imprisoned.<ref>\'\'Tony Stark: Iron Man\'\' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe visual appearance and powers of the character have varied, but common powers include [[superhuman]] levels of strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes; flight at subsonic speeds; and various offensive weapons such as concussive blasts of energy fired from its optical sensors or hands and an "encephalo-ray", which places victims into a deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and mind-control victims, or implant [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron also has the ability to convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical energy for use or storage. Ultron has a genius intellect, a capacity for creative intelligence and self-repair, superhuman [[cybernetic]] analytical capabilities, and the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy. The character is an expert roboticist and strategist.\n\nUltron\'s outer armor is usually composed primarily of adamantium, which is almost completely impervious to damage.{{efn|The first use of the term \'\'adamantium\'\' in Marvel Comics was made in reference to Ultron in \'\'Avengers\'\' #66, published in July 1969.}} Most Ultron units are powered by a small internal [[nuclear power|nuclear]] furnace and incorporate a "program transmitter" which can transmit part or all of Ultron\'s memory/personality system into other computer systems or duplicate robotic bodies. Ultron can also control other machines remotely. Ultron has occasionally reformed itself with a humanoid appearance above the waist and the appearance of a complex machine, including [[tractor beam]] apparatus for flight, below the waist. A later Ultron model developed [[Swarm intelligence|hive mind]] technology, allowing it to animate and control hundreds of other Ultron bodies simultaneously,<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' vol. 3, #19â22 (AugustâNovember 1999)</ref> although only the \'prime\' Ultron was composed of adamantium while others were made of steel or secondary adamantium due to the lack of resources to give all the Ultrons adamantium bodies.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' vol. 3, #22 (November 1999)</ref> Ultron also used an internal molecular rearranger that renders the adamantium components of its workings more malleable and so has the ability to restructure its physical form.
