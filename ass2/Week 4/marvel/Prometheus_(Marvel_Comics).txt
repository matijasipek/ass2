His siblings included Atlas, Menoetius, and Epimetheus. When their uncle Cronus' rule is challenged by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]], Prometheus and Epimetheus sided with the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympians]] while Atlas and Menoetius sided with Cronus. With the help of Prometheus and Epimetheus, the Olympians defeat the Titans. Prometheus and Epimetheus take an interest in mankind and became the joint rulers in Phthia. Prometheus takes an interest in the humans and later learns various skills from [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]] that concern Zeus. When Prometheus takes fire from the Gods and teaches the humans how to cook, Zeus has Kratos and Bia bind Prometheus to a pillar in the Caucasian Mountains using chains that were forged by [[Hephaestus (Marvel Comics)|Hephaestus]]. Zeus also has an eagle peck out Prometheus' liver which grew back every night. Zeus  offers to shorten his life of being chained to a pillar if he would give him the vision of the prophecy that would one day dethrone Zeus. Seven generations later, [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] comes across Prometheus during his [[Labours of Hercules|12 Labours]] when on his way to the Amazons. Hercules kills the eagle and then frees Prometheus. Zeus is at first against this, but decides to end Prometheus' punishment. Prometheus foresaw this event and vows to repay Hercules one day.<ref>''Greek Myths''</ref>\n\nIn the modern era, Hercules is injured in a fight with [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] where [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]] drugs Hercules causing him to charge into battle. When Zeus (who was unaware that the Masters of Evil were responsible for Hercules ending up in a coma) has [[Neptune (Marvel Comics)|Neptune]] abduct [[Namor]] and bring him to the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]], Prometheus manages to heal Namor after he escaped Cerberus and made it across the [[Phlegethon]] River. He then directs Namor to where the other [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] are being held which happens to be the Garrison of the Accursed at Fortress Tartarus.<ref>''The Avengers'' #282. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards, the Avengers make their way to Mount Olympus, where Prometheus speaks to them while they were in the woods. Zeus catches up to the Avengers while [[Doctor Druid]] heals Hercules' brain, Prometheus then declares that the battle between man and gods has begun.<ref>''The Avengers'' #283. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Zeus continues his fight with the Avengers, [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]] sides with Prometheus and [[Hermes (Marvel Comics)|Hermes]]. Prometheus heals [[Captain America]] and Doctor Druid before proceeding to try his luck into healing Hercules where Doctor Druid and [[Apollo (Marvel Comics)|Apollo]] have failed. Under the advice of Hermes, Prometheus calls upon Gaea's help to do so while [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Monica Rambeau|Captain Marvel]] continue their fight with Zeus. When Captain Marvel attempts to attack Zeus, the blinding light she gives off distracted Prometheus which causes Hercules to be revived in a state of paranoia, in which he attacks Prometheus.<ref>''The Avengers'' #284. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Doctor Druid manages to fully heal Hercules' mind. After Zeus' attack was halted, Prometheus arrives, showing signs of aging with some of his hair turning white. Prometheus then attends a reception on Mount Olympus. Before teleporting the Avengers away, Prometheus warns the Avengers that there will be many challenges to come to them and that mankind will be sorely tested by one of them.<ref>''The Avengers'' #285.

The Pantheon is led by [[Agamemnon (Pantheon)|Agamemnon]], the father of all its super-powered members. Prometheus is born with a deformed face that looks horribly burned. He drives a very high tech vehicle created by the Pantheon engineers called the Argo, and debuted trying to kidnap Bruce Banner (the [[Hulk]]'s alter-ego).{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nHe later assists the Hulk by transporting his wife, [[Betty Ross|Betty Banner]]. He expects her to react badly to his burnt face, but instead she insults his smoking habit.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nPrometheus is an excellent tracker even over interstellar distances. He uses this as part of a mission to help fellow Pantheon member [[Atalanta (Pantheon)|Atalanta]]. While rescuing her, they learn that Agamemnon had gained his resources by selling out his future descendants.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nBecause of this Agamemnon is captured and put on trial.
