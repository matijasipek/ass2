However, she was bored, and only found entertainment from classic literature, such as \'\'[[Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]\'\', her favorite. As she grew older, her family married her off to an older gentleman named Lewis Dodson (a name derived from the author of the Alice in Wonderland books, [[Lewis Carroll]], whose real name was \'\'\'Charles Dodgson\'\'\'). At the time of the marriage, she was twenty-five and he was eighty-two. She resented being treated as a [[trophy wife]], so she killed her husband; the police thought it was an accident. After that, she would only mention that he "died happy", and subsequently used her inheritance to buy various gadgets so that she could experience a life full of danger and excitement. She became the \'\'\'White Rabbit\'\'\', an eccentric female criminal, whose costume resembled a cross between the literary character from \'\'Alice in Wonderland\'\' and a [[Playboy Bunny]]. While the White Rabbit is clearly insane to the point of being completely ridiculous, she is quite articulate and has a great knowledge of literature. At some point early in her career she was trying to establish her reputation and confronted Deadpool, who was bonded with the Venom symbiote. She used an array of carrot bombs and mutant rabbits, as well as stealing only watches.<ref>\'\'Deadpool: Back in Black\'\' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> She spent her first days as a criminal robbing various fast food joints, most notably "Kwikkee Burger". She and her gang were eventually confronted by [[Frog-Man]] (a frequent customer at Kwikkee Burger), who was able to defeat her hired help only with [[Spider-Man]]\'s aid. The White Rabbit escaped, but struck later at a book fair, where she found the two superheroes once again. The White Rabbit, witnessing her men getting defeated, fled using her jet-boots, but they began to malfunction, allowing Frog-Man to knock her into a building.<ref>\'\'Marvel Team-Up\'\' #131. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMuch later, she resurfaced, plotting to get her revenge on Frog-Man. She allied herself with the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]], but they were defeated by Spider-Man, Frog-Man, and Frog-Man\'s father, [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]].<ref>\'\'The Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #185. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ditching the Walrus, she popped up again later with two new villains, Mad Hatter and Dormouse, though they were both actually hired actors, as no other supervillains would work with the White Rabbit. She formed a new plan by capturing [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] and [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]] and ransoming them for one billion dollars in gold. She also created several genetically-altered rabbits, who were ready to eat Grizzly and Gibbon. The Mayor, however, only offered the White Rabbit $2.50, which caused her to fly into a rage and raise the ransom to five billion dollars (this time the Rabbit demanded that the ransom be paid entirely in quarters), but Spider-Man, under the alias of the Bombastic Bag-Man - as he was currently wanted for murder as Spider-Man thanks to the machinations of [[Norman Osborn]], he was forced to use an alternative costume and lacked the time to get any of his other new costumes (See \'\'[[Identity Crisis (Marvel Comics)]]\'\') - infiltrated the White Rabbit\'s hideout and battled her giant rabbit robot. She was then knocked out by Grizzly (who claimed he did it so he would not be accused of being sexist); he and his partner had escaped, remembering Gibbon\'s natural affinity with the Animal Kingdom and thus taming the GM Rabbits.<ref>\'\'The Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #253. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>\'\'The Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #256. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhite Rabbit was later seen at an auction in which the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom Symbiote]] and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] suit was sold.<ref>\'\'Marvel Knights: Spider-Man\'\' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>\'\'Marvel Knights: Spider-Man\'\' #12</ref> She tried to rob another bank, but was interrupted by Grizzly. However, she escaped and the police arrested Grizzly by mistake.<ref>\'\'Secret War: From the Files of Nicky Fury\'\' #1 (2004). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the limited series \'\'Claws\'\', the White Rabbit, her outfit modified (now more than ever resembling a Playboy Bunny), became romantically involved with [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]], a man with a dedication for drama and who controls \'Murderworlds\', where people are killed off in carnivalesque ways. They go after [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. The two heroes manage to defeat Arcade and the White Rabbit. They are dropped off in the [[Savage Land]], a prehistoric land hidden deep in the Antarctic. The White Rabbit became queen of a group of tribal warriors.<ref>\'\'Claws\'\' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\'\' storyline, White Rabbit appears as a member of the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]\'s gang. She is part of a sub-group of said gang that attacks [[Mister Negative]]. The motive is because he will not hand over his control of the criminal underworld in New York\'s \'Chinatown\'.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Mister Negative\'\' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhite Rabbit is next seen in [[Los Angeles]], where she is working as a drug dealer to the rich and famous. One of her clients is Bobby Carr, [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]]\'s boyfriend. Carr is also an actor and is using Mutant Growth Hormone to bulk up for a movie role. The Rabbit turned on her client when the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] wanted him to inform them who his dealer is. White Rabbit and her gang attacked Carr and MJ at a trendy Los Angeles club, gassing the party goers. Mary Jane rescued Carr and took out White Rabbit at the club, when the police arrived and took the White Rabbit into custody.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #605. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'[[Spider-Island]]\'\' storyline, White Rabbit (alongside [[Chance (comics)#Chance (Nicholas Powell)|Chance]] and [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]]) attacks Peter Parker and [[Carlie Cooper]] at an abandoned lab that the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] is in at Empire State University. She ends up knocked down by Peter using the moves learned from [[Shang-Chi]].<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #669. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \'\'Dying Wish\'\' arc, White Rabbit later makes a cameo at the Raft at the time when [[Hydro-Man]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], and [[Trapster]] spring [[Doctor Octopus]] (whose mind has been swapped with Peter\'s mind) out of the Raft.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #699. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhite Rabbit was then seen trying to rob a truck with two goons but when the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octavius\'s mind in Spider-Man\'s body) arrived they quickly surrendered, as they did not wanted to be beaten in the same way he previously did to both Boomerang and Vulture.<ref>\'\'The Superior Spider-Man\'\' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhite Rabbit later appeared as a member of the Menagerie (which also consisted of [[Hippo (comics)|Hippo]], [[Skein (comics)|Skein]], and a new villain called Panda-Mania). They were on a rampage stealing expensive eggs from an auction. White Rabbit named the group the Menagerie because of the villains\' animal themes, even though Skein did not use the Gypsy Moth name.

She also has two custom-modified vehicles: a [[zeppelin]] called the Flying Hare, and a van called the Bunnymobile.\n\nDue to her ridiculous appearance, insanity, lack of judgement and bad reputation, few people take her seriously, and she is generally dismissed as a raving lunatic.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Marvel Adventures===\n* White Rabbit appears in the \'\'[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]\'\' series. She is romantically interested in [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], and she even writes to him when he is in the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]].

However, Spider-Man figures out the plan and defeats Venom and White Rabbit.<ref>\'\'Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man\'\' #35.
