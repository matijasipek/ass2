Eventually his good personality resurfaces, causing him to quit crime and hide the Philosopher\'s Stone. Shortly after, a new Doctor Alchemy appears and is revealed to be his astral twin \'\'\'"Alvin" Desmond\'\'\', with whom he shares a psychic link.

Petrov is promoted to replace the dead supervisor and discovers he likes the thrill of killing. He continues to eliminate members of the department he sees as "threats" to his position, using the weapon and ice-based effects.

His plan comes undone when profiler [[Ashley Zolomon]] enters his office as he is putting on his mask.
