He first appeared in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Green Lantern Corps: Recharge]]'' #1 (November 2005), and was created by writers [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Dave Gibbons]], and artist [[Patrick Gleason (artist)|Patrick Gleason]]. He was named after editor Peter Tomasi, in that Isamot is Tomasi spelled backwards.\n\n==Fictional character history==\nKol is a Lizarkon (a [[humanoid]] [[lizard]] belonging to one of the many different species who inhabit Thanagar) and a veteran soldier of the [[Rann-Thanagar War]]. As member of the Imperial Thanagarian Army, Kol was scheduled to be executed for killing his commanding officer because his superior wanted to surrender to a squadron of [[Rann (fictional planet)|Rann]]ians. Kol explains to a fellow prisoner that he hates cowards, and that after killing his superior, he and the rest of his squad defeated the Rannians, and that his fellow soldiers attempted to report the superior’s death as an accident, but Kol, who personally held truth as a guiding principle, refused to lie.<ref name=glcr1>''Green Lantern Corps: Recharge'' #1 (November 2005)</ref>\n\nAt the exact moment before he was to be executed however, he is saved by a Green Lantern power ring, the powerful weapon assigned to each member of the Green Lantern Corps.<ref name=glcr1 /> The Corps was in the process of recruiting 7,200 new members in an effort to rebuild their ranks following their destruction at the hands of the villain [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. The rings allow their bearers to conjure virtually any object or form of energy limited only by the imagination and willpower of the wearer, and thus the ring, which includes a [[Sentience|sentient]] computer, frees Kol from his bonds, and allows him to escape his captors. His fellow prisoner begs to be taken also but Kol refuses, believing the man to have actually earned his fate.<ref name=glcr1 />\n\nKol is brought to the planet Oa, home to the extraterrestrial [[Guardians of the Universe]] who administer and oversee the Corps, for Green Lantern training.<ref name=glcr1 />\n\n===Spider Guild===\nKol is given a temporary badge and partnered with fellow new recruit [[Vath Sarn]], a Rannian who was also plucked from the war. In contrast to Sarn’s discipline and adaptability, Kol still saw Sarn as an enemy from the war, and instigated conflict with him as they began their first assignment. This was diverting ships away from Star 38, which, like several recent stars, had begun to show signs of instability. Kol was also slow to adapt to Corps protocols, questioning his orders, and even threatening an Okaaran hospital ship that fired upon him after refusing to change course from the star. The star eventually went [[supernova]], and the two new recruits valiantly attempted to pull the ship from the ensuing black hole, but were sucked in. This was part of a planned attack by the Spider Guild, operating from the forbidden Vegan system.\n\nThey are discovered by the GL trainer [[Kilowog]], who had broken Lantern rules to find them. Isamot and Sarn, forced to go on by themselves due to Kilowog not being able to fit in the tunnels they were using, find out the Guild's plans to invade [[Oa]].\n\nThe Guild detect them and attack. The three join up with [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] and [[Kyle Rayner]], who had also broken the rules to rescue the missing and unwilling GL recruit [[Soranik Natu]]. Soranik's unwillingness to be a Lantern causes Kol to perceive her as a traitor. Despite this and other conflicts, the six Lanterns successfully make it back to Oa.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps: Recharge'' #4 (February 2006)</ref> They help in driving off the invasion of Guild forces.\n\n===Thanagar problems===\nIsamot decides to reduce his serving time from the Green Lantern Corps, due to the mating urges (akin to a [[Pon farr]]) as a member of his species. He announced his desire to serve back again on Thanagar for a while, living with his intended mate Qaylyra, another saurian.\n\nOn his unfortune, [[Citadel (comics)|Citadel]] forces, alleged allies of Rann, attack Thanagar just as Isamot's mate enters her only receptive mating period.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #4 (November 2006)</ref> Isamot then must choose between his partner and the only possibility of a family. He chose his partner but by the time he returned she had taken another mate. With the mating urges over he returns to full duty. He later visits Mogo on Vath's advice for Mogo to council him on the pain for his recent loss, but rejects the therapy after noticing something is amiss when Green Man is behaving strangely.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #10</ref> When he, Vath, and Bzzd were sent after Guy Gardner, who was accused of murdering two fellow Green Lanterns, and confronted him on Mogo, Isamot was the first to believe Guy's story of something bizarre happening on Mogo due to his earlier suspicions. After arriving later, Soranik Natu, a medical expert, confirms that Mogo is infected with a disease created by the mushroom spores laid across its surface, and Isamot assists his fellow Lanterns in curing Mogo, while fighting off Kilowog, due to Kilowog also having been infected.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #13</ref>\n\nIsamot fights alongside Vath during the [[Sinestro Corps War]]. Later, he is forcibly pulled to Oa to take part in a treaty-breaking incursion into the depths of Okarran space, along with other Green Lanterns. The very act of being taken to Oa causes him to disrupt Thanagar flying police officers, who scoff and insult the very concept of a 'downsider' Green Lantern.\n\nIsamot is part of a Green Lantern force sent to the time-ravaged Earth. The Lanterns join with dozens of other powered beings to put an end to Darkseid's plans for the planet.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #5 (December 2008)</ref>\n\n===Blackest Night===\n{{main|Blackest Night}}\nA swarm of black power rings descend on Oa, turning all the honored dead in the Lantern crypt into [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]], who promptly attack the living Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (September 2009)</ref> As Isamot and Varth find themselves overwhelmed by the onslaught of the dead, they are saved by a member of the [[Indigo Tribe]].<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 2) #41 (December 2009)</ref> When Varth loses his legs to the Black Lanterns, Kol has his own legs amputated so that they can be transplanted onto Varth, Kol's reptilian physiology allowing him to regrow his limbs and wanting to give his friend and partner a chance to continue his service in the Corps.\n\n===The New 52===\nIsamot is part of an army of Green Lanterns sent to fight an army of genocidal warriors. Their first Lantern victims include Siram and Bboc. This hits Isamot especially hard, as the two were part of his recruit class. In fighting the warriors, Isamot is sucked through a dimensional breach to their homeworld. He loses all of his limbs but this is something he can recover from in time.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 3) #2 (December 2011)</ref> He survives this and becomes a prisoner of war with several Lanterns until another force led by Guy Gardner rescues everyone. Isamot rejoins a squad backed up by a veteran team of Lanterns called the 'Mean Machine'. They learn the army were former caretakers of the Lantern Corps actual lanterns, until the removal of them devastated the army's home world. Isamot and his allies, using the murder of two Sciencell prisoners, breaks the morale of the genocidal army and ultimately defeats them.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 3) #3-6 (January–April 2012)</ref> Later after Salaak and Kilowog discovered the Guardian's plans for the Third Army, Isamot was among the trusted members that Kilowog contacted and recruited to oppose the Guardians and later fought alongside his comrades against the Third Army. The Third Army was the Guardian's plans to turn every person in the galaxy into obedient slaves. This is neutralized when Sinestro kills most of the original Guardians.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 3) Annual #1</ref>\n\nLater, Isamot is seen fighting alongside fellow Lanterns to protect the [[Indigo Tribe]] from the forces of the New Gods.<ref>''Sinestro'' #6 (October 2014)</ref> He later becomes a prisoner of those entities along with many of his Corps.<ref>''Green Lantern: New Guardians'' #37 (February 2015)</ref>\n\nAs with most Green Lanterns, Isamot Kol became lost in the universe proceeding this one. He is seen safely with a small squadron of other Lanterns, having seen the beacon Mogo sent out.<ref>''Green Lantern Corps: Edge of Oblivion'' #1 (Jan. 2016)</ref> Isamot is later seen with the reformed, struggling Corps, rescuing Xudarians from Starro. <ref>''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' (vol. 4) #13 (March 2017)</ref> After answering what seems to be a pointless emergency call, Isamot and Sarn find a heretofore unknown Guardian allied with the current Green Lanterns of Earth. They are later tasked by current Corps Leader John Stewart to return and fetch the Guardian and the Earth Lanterns back to Mogo.\n\n===Infinite Frontier===\nIn the ''Green Lantern'' series (2021), during the events of Oa's hosting of the United Planets Conclave and the subsequent attack upon Oa, Isamot was among the many Green Lanterns assigned to stay in the known sector population.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 6) #1-2 (April/May 2021)</ref> Because of this, he was on Oa when the destruction of the Corps Battery occurred. Due to the explosion, several Green Lanterns lost their lives. Isamot was counted amongst the dead.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 6) #4 (July 2021)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n* Isamot Kol is one of the Green Lanterns in animated film ''[[Green Lantern: First Flight]]'', where he is seen fighting [[Sinestro]].\n* Isamot Kol appears in the 2011 live action film ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]''. When [[Sinestro]] appears to give his speech to the Corps, Isamot can be seen in the crowd. His appearance is very similar to the comics, albeit less humanoid and appearing more alien in nature. He is later chosen to be part of Sinestro's elite squad and is promptly killed by [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. Isamot is also part of the film toy line.<ref>Inguanzo, Ozzy. ''Constructing Green Lantern: From Page to Screen''. Universe. 2011.</ref>\n* Isamot's romantic life is examined in the book ''Green Lantern and Philosophy: No Evil Shall Escape This Book''.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Green Lantern and Philosophy: No Evil Shall Escape this Book|last= Dryden|first= Jane|year= 2011|publisher= John Wiley & Sons|ISBN= 9781118003299}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Green Lantern}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:DC Comics extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Geoff Johns]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dave Gibbons]]\n[[Category:Green Lantern Corps officers]]"}]}}}}
