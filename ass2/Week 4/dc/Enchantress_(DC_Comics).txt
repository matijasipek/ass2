One of the world\'s most dangerous magic users, she struggles to contain the dark personality and intentions of her Enchantress persona. She is a member of several groups such as the Suicide Squad and, as a hero, a member of Shadowpact and the Sentinels of Magic. In more recent continuities, the Enchantress is instead an interdimensional witch possessing the human June Moone and is considered a separate entity from June although the two share the same body. This version of the character is cast as a member of Justice League Dark as June Moone while both June and Enchantress would serve as a re-occurring member of the Suicide Squad, appearing in a new incarnation of the team in the fifth volume of the comic series as well as appearing as a member of its paranormal counterpart.\n\nThe Enchantress would make an appearance in mainstream media, portrayed by [[Cara Delevingne]] in the 2016 film \'\'[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]\'\' as both June Moone and the Enchantress, the latter portrayed as a separate entity possessing her body. The Enchantress entity would also be portrayed by Samantha Liana Cole on the show \'\'[[Legends of Tomorrow]]\'\', which is part of the [[Arrowverse]]. Enchantress and June Moone would make an appearance in \'\'[[Injustice 2]]\'\' similar to their recent depictions although the Enchantress entity, the playable fighter, would describe herself as an actual [[Succubus|succubus]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Enchantress ("The Switcheroo-Witcheroo" as she was bannered on the cover) first appeared in the nine-page lead story of \'\'Strange Adventures\'\' #187 (April 1966),<ref name="TerrorCastle">{{cite comic|writer= [[Bob Haney|Haney, Bob]]|penciller= [[Howard Purcell|Purcell, Howard]]|inker= [[Sheldon Moldoff|Moldoff, Sheldon]]|story= The Enchantress of Terror Castle|title= [[Strange Adventures]]|issue=#187|date= April 1966}}</ref> the [[DC Comics#Golden Age|National Comics]] (now DC Comics) flagship science fiction anthology title.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=119}}</ref> She then appeared in two eight-page appearances in the same title: \'\'Strange Adventures\'\' #191 (August 1966)<ref name="BeautyBeast">{{cite comic|writer= Haney, Bob|penciller= Purcell, Howard|inker= Purcell, Howard|story= Beauty vs. the Beast|title= Strange Adventures|issue=#191|date= August 1966}}</ref> and 200 (May 1967),<ref name="GuardianEye">{{cite comic|writer= Haney, Bob|penciller= Purcell, Howard|inker= Purcell, Howard|story= The Guardian Eye|title= Strange Adventures|issue=#200|date= May 1967}}</ref> written by Bob Haney and drawn by co-creator Howard Purcell.<ref name="Markstein">{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/enchantr.htm |title=The Enchantress |first=Don |last=Markstein |date=2010 |website=[[Don Markstein\'s Toonopedia]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6daZJsZP2?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/enchantr.htm |archive-date=December 7, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first two stories were reprinted in \'\'[[Adventure Comics]]\'\' #417 (March 1972) and 419 (May 1972), her only appearances in the 1970s.\n\nFollowing this, the Enchantress appeared in two linked [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] tales in \'\'[[The Superman Family]]\'\' #204–205 (November/December 1980–January/February 1981).<ref name="Earthquake">{{cite comic|writer= [[Jack C.
