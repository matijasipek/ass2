Palmer]], who was himself quite short.) After stumbling onto a mass of [[white dwarf star]] matter that had fallen to Earth, he fashioned a [[lens (optics)|lens]] which allowed him to shrink down to subatomic size. Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from the white dwarf star material of his costume, controlled by mechanisms in his belt, and later by controls in the palms of his gloves. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers within his own body. After the events of \'\'[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]],\'\' Ray shrank himself to microscopic size and disappeared.

Palmer and Loring got a divorce. Later, Palmer offers his blessing to the couple when they marry, and he offers Hoben his size-changing belt so that Hoben can protect [[Ivy Town]] after Ray returns to the [[List of hidden races in DC Comics#M|Morlaidhans]]. Adam Cray would later steal this belt; Hoben never uses the costume or name of the Atom.\n\n===Adam Cray===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of DC Comics characters: A]] -->\n[[File:SuicideSquad46.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Adam Cray, \'\'Suicide Squad\'\' #46.]]\n\n\'\'\'Adam Cray\'\'\', son of the murdered Senator Joseph Cray, first appeared as the Atom in the pages of \'\'[[Suicide Squad]]\'\' #44 by [[John Ostrander]] (August 1990). Cray was initially believed to be Ray Palmer in disguise by members of the team. Cray had been recruited by Palmer (who faked his own death) to apprehend the Micro Squad, a group of villains that had been reduced in size. Palmer intended to use Cray to uncover a shadowy government cabal which was using Palmer to discover the secret identities of other costumed heroes (Palmer\'s own identity no longer being secret). While Palmer infiltrated the Micro Squad, Cray would attract the attention of the Cabal as the new Atom so that no one would notice Palmer assuming the identity of a fallen Micro Squad member.\n\nAdam Cray remained with the Suicide Squad briefly, serving as a secret weapon whose existence was unknown to others of the Squad. Cray saves Amanda Waller from a group of assassins. At one point, Cray approaches [[Deadshot]] about his role in Senator Cray\'s murder. Later, Cray is impaled through the chest with a screw by Blacksnake, a Micro Squad member who believes him to be Palmer.\n\nAfter the unanticipated murder of Cray, Palmer reveals himself and defeats Cray\'s murderer. The ruse ended, Palmer explains himself to the Justice League, who had been searching for him after hearing rumors of a new Atom.\n\nDuring the events of \'\'[[Blackest Night]]\'\', Adam\'s corpse is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members.<ref>\'\'Suicide Squad\'\' #67 (January 2010)</ref> Following his reanimation, Adam and the other Black Lanterns travel to Belle Reve and attack [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] and [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]].<ref>\'\'Secret Six\'\' vol. 3 #17 (January 2010)</ref> Adam is apparently destroyed by the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunter]]\'s self-destruct mechanism, unleashing an explosion of [[Green Lantern]] energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns.<ref>\'\'Secret Six\'\' vol. 3 #18 (February 2010)</ref>\n\nIn [[DC Rebirth]], Adam Cray is the son of Senator Cray and Ryan Choi\'s roommate at Ivy University.

She also reveals that by placing a sliver of Green Kryptonite in Superman\'s optic nerve, she caused him to accidentally kill [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]], with the added effect of severely weakening and almost killing Superman over time.<ref>\'\'Justice League\'\' vol. 2 #23</ref>\n\nAtomica originally worked on Earth-3 with [[Johnny Quick]] as a thief and killer.

At the end of the bridge, he finds [[Superman (Kal Kent)|Superman Prime]] who came to help but was too late. Stranded, he searches this universe for remnants of the one he lost, in time taking the name the Atom and joining the [[Justice Legion Alpha]] when he helped them defeat the Bizarro-Legion. This Atom\'s powers differ from his predecessors in that he doesn\'t shrink but breaks up into several smaller duplicates of himself divided amongst his mass.
