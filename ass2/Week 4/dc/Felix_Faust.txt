[[5th millennium BC|5,000 BC]], at which time he appeared in the legendary African empire of Kor. The king of Kor was [[Doctor Mist|Nommo]], the prime wizard of his time and the guardian of the mystic power called the Flame of Life. The evil sorcerer battled Nommo, attempting to use the Flame\'s power to his own corrupt ends. Nommo then called the Flame of Life into himself, defeating the sorcerer by banishing him to another dimension.<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation |last=Wallace |first=Dan |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia |page=120 |year=2008 |editor-last=Dougall |editor-first=Alastair |contribution=Felix Faust |place=New York |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |isbn=978-0-7566-4119-1 |oclc=213309017}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1920s, a madman and aspiring magician named Dekan Drache stumbled upon the dimension and managed to open a portal to it. Released, the sorcerer destroyed Drache\'s soul and entered his body. However, though alive on Earth once more, the sorcerer found his powers drastically reduced.<ref name="dc-ency"/>\n\nObsessed with restoring his mystic might, the sorcerer read the story of how the man called [[Faust]] had sold his soul to the devil for supernatural powers, and decided to do the same. Inspired by the story\'s main character, the sorcerer now called himself \'\'\'Felix Faust\'\'\' and began a never-ending quest for mystical knowledge.<ref name=":2">{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=128}}</ref>\n\n=== \'\'Justice League of America\'\' ===\nFelix Faust first appeared in \'\'Justice League of America\'\', vol. 1, #10 (March 1962), when he tried to regain some of his lost magical abilities by contacting the Demons Three, three fictional demons in the DC Universe.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=100}}</ref> These three demons were brothers who ruled the galaxy a billion years ago before being banished by beings known as the Timeless Ones. The Demons Three have tried to return time and again, summoned by Felix Faust and others, their attempts always foiled by the Justice League. Felix Faust tried to summon the power of the Demons Three by possessing three artifacts: the Green Bell of Uthool, the Silver Wheel of Nyorlath, and the Red Jar of Calythos, that had been created by the Demons, and which the Timeless Ones could not destroy or move from Earth. Pre-\'\'Crisis\'\', they claimed a spell using the artifacts would free them in 100 years, but in that time the caster of the spell would be able to command them. To do this he takes control of the JLA with the Demons\' help, who find and defeat the artifact\'s guardians and bring them to Faust who begins the spell, but Aquaman is able to break the spell by distracting him using his control of fish. The sorcerer is then taken to prison, and the JLA soon after find out about the Demons\' escape and re-imprison them.<ref name="dc-ency"/>\n\nPre-\'\'Crisis\'\', he was a member of the Crime Champions, a trio of Earth-1 criminals who teamed up with a trio of Earth-2 villains to commit crimes, then escape to the other world using a vibratory device accidentally discovered by the [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]]. Felix Faust stole $1,000,000 from a sunken ship and escaped [[Aquaman]], the [[Martian Manhunter]] and the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]]. Later, the Earth-2 Crime Champions impersonated the Earth-1 Crime Champions using the Wizard\'s magic, in an attempt to trap the JLA. The Fiddler impersonated Felix Faust. They robbed [[Casino]] Town (evidently based on [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]), and \'Felix Faust\' contacted the JLA. The Fiddler was, oddly enough, able to cast spells like Faust and battled Aquaman, the Martian Manhunter, and the Atom. The real Felix Faust, while robbing a fair on Earth-2, was confronted by [[Green Arrow]], the Martian Manhunter, and the Atom but, despite casting a spell that made them spin in midair, he was knocked out by the Atom. When the Crime Champions were fully defeated, [[Doctor Fate]], [[Batman]], and the Earth-1 Flash defeated Faust.\n\nOver the years, Faust\'s hunger for magical power proved very costly to him. He had bargained his soul away for knowledge on many occasions, only to buy it back later when his acquisitions failed to help him meet his goals; every time, he would end up worse than before. Eventually, he found it difficult to find any mystics willing to purchase his tarnished soul. Finally, he tried to trick [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] into giving him power by offering the pure soul of an innocent girl he murdered in lieu of his own. Unfortunately for him, Neron saw through the ruse and punished Faust by setting the girl\'s vengeful spirit upon him. For a time, Faust\'s damned soul languished in a [[Hell (DC Comics)|hellish]] plane for magicians who had abused or ignored the laws of magic.\n\n=== Outsiders vol. 2 (1993-1995) ===\nFelix would appear as one of the antagonists in the second \'\'Outsiders\'\' series; learning of his son\'s activities in the Outsiders team, he attempts to track him by sending in mystic creatures tasked with bringing Sebastian to him. Initially fearing his father\'s return, Halo encourages Sebastian to realize his father is not infalliable, leading him to counter his spell back at Felix. Having now found him, Felix begans working to hunting down his son and manipulate the team. With Fauna as his accomplice, Felix hospitalizes Halo and kidnaps Sebastian. When the team manages to teleport to Felix\'s hideout using one of Sebastian\'s artifacts. Escaping, the team learns Sebastian survived the ordeal and Felix\'s plot includes gathering the artifacts knowns as the "Green Bell of Uthool" and the "Silver Wheel of Nyorlath" before being sent off by Sebastian with a divining spell. Meanwhile, Felix manipulates Wylde into working alongside him with promises to undo Sebastian\'s magic that makes him a bear-like beast (a feat Sebastian was unable to undo) and earn Looker\' affections. When the team gathers the artifacts, Wylde intervenes and uses the artifacts, resulting in the creation of a dimension where Felix possess god-like power. The Outsiders and Felix battle, the sorcerer using Wylde and Fauna to buy more time before the artifacts can fully grant him power. Eventually, the injured Halo is used by Looker\'s telepathic abiliteis to destroy the artifacts, undoing Felix\'s plan.\n\n=== \'\'52\'\' ===\n{{main|52 (comics)}}\nDuring the event known as \'\'[[52 (comics)|52]]\'\', a voice from within the helm of [[Doctor Fate]] speaks to [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]] and promises to fulfill his desires if he makes certain sacrifices. Dibny journeys with the helm through the [[afterlife|afterlives]] of several cultures, where he is cautioned about the use of magic and sees Felix Faust. He is told about their deals by the voice. The [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] promises to resurrect his late wife Sue in exchange for Dibny\'s taking vengeance on her murderer, [[Jean Loring]], but Dibny is unable to do so.<ref name="dc-ency"/>\n\nAt [[Nanda Parbat]], Rama Kushna tells Dibny, "The end is already written". In [[Doctor Fate]]\'s tower, Dibny begins the spell to resurrect Sue, puts on the helmet of Fate, and shoots it, revealing Felix Faust, who was posing as Nabu. Faust planned to trade Dibny\'s soul to Neron in exchange for his own freedom.\n\nRalph reveals that he was aware of Faust\'s identity for some time, and that the binding spell surrounding the tower is designed to imprison Faust, not to counter any negative effects of the spell. Neron appears and kills Dibny, only to realize too late that the binding spell responds only to Dibny\'s commands: through his death Ralph has trapped Faust and Neron in the tower.\n\n===One Year Later===\nOne year after \'\'[[Infinite Crisis]]\'\', with Neron having already escaped, Faust escapes from the Tower of Fate with the help of [[Black Adam]] through the aid of a revived [[Isis (DC Comics)|Isis]], and contacted [[Red Tornado]]\'s soul which was still adrift after fighting [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Alexander Luthor]] alongside [[Donna Troy]], the [[Green Lantern Corps]], and their allies. Working with [[Dr. Impossible]], [[Professor Ivo]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]], Faust posed as [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] and offered the android his heart\'s desire: a human body. The Tornado accepted, and Faust bound his soul into his new body. Faust and his allies then stole the Red Tornado\'s original android body for their own purposes.\n\nAfter lending his concealment spells to [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], Faust joined with [[Talia al Ghul]] in order to corrupt yet another hero: [[Black Alice (comics)|Black Alice]]. Faust offered Alice power, wealth, a place in the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], and the resurrection of her mother, but Alice refused, sent Faust out of town, and tapped into his powers so she could perform the resurrection herself. After this, Faust seemed to rejoin the Society.\n\nOn the cover of \'\'Justice League of America\'\' (vol. 2) #13, it shows Felix Faust as a member of the latest incarnation of the [[Injustice League]].\n\n===Post-\'\'Final Crisis\'\'===\nAs a member of [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]]\'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], Felix Faust played a part in the creation of [[Genocide (comics)|Genocide]] when he used his magic to animate the collected soil samples.<ref>\'\'Wonder Woman\'\' (vol. 3) #26</ref>\n\n===Further appearances===\nFelix Faust has been shown retaining his control over Isis even after he used her powers to free himself from Fate Towers by creating a doorway. Forced to keep Isis under a powerful sedation spell at all times, he\'s implied to regularly sexually abuse the young goddess. Still unable to communicate, Isis manages to signal her husband Black Adam to her aid via a trail of Isis flowers. Once Black Adam discovers Isis he forces Faust to free his wife, who in retaliation castrates Faust with her bare hands before leaving, sparing his life.<ref>\'\'Justice Society of America\'\' #23 (2009)</ref>\n\n===\'\'The New 52\'\'===\nAfter the \'\'[[New 52]]\'\' reboot, a new version of Felix Faust appeared, his powers having been expressed to have weakened significantly from the reality shift present in \'\'Flashpoint\'\' and other mutliversal shifts. Like his prior version, the character\'s complete background remains unknown and has fathered both Fauna and Sebastian Faust at some point in his life. Unlike his prior version, the character is expressed to be the son of a sorcerer named Majika the Great and sold Sebastian\'s soul in an attempt to garner immortality (unlike the previous versions where he attempted to obtain magical power).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wolfman |first=Marv |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1158965953 |title=Raven, daughter of darkness.

Faust was about to cast a spell to escape by transferring [[Superman]]\'s powers into himself, but Penguin seized the opportunity, stole the Superman powers from Faust, and broke out easily, leaving Faust behind. Faust later stripped Penguin of Superman\'s powers, and gained them himself after he had his spirits apprehend Penguin. He also proved vulnerable to [[Kryptonite]] when [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] changed part of his burnoose into it. [[Wonder Woman]] used her lasso to force Felix Faust into relinquishing Superman\'s powers. The two were again jailed in the same cell much to the dismay of both.\n\n[[File:Felixfaustanimated.png|thumbnail|right|Felix Faust as seen in \'\'[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]\'\'.]]\n* Felix Faust made multiple appearances in the [[DC animated universe]], voiced by [[Robert Englund]]:\n** Felix Faust appears in \'\'[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]\'\'. Originally a professor of archaeology with a heretic interest in magic and the dark arts, he becomes a sorcerer prior to being expelled from the university where he taught, using his sorcery to exact his revenge on those who scorned him. In "Paradise Lost", Faust transforms the resident [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] into stone with a Gorgon talisman to force Wonder Woman to gather the parts of a key to open the gate to Tartarus, domain of [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]], making a pact with the god for "ultimate knowledge" in return. Wonder Woman manages to get the help of her friends from the Justice League in her quest for the key. Once Batman discovers Faust\'s intentions, the League decide not to give Faust the key without a fight. However, Faust gets the key and escapes. Faust manages to free Hades and even provides him with [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]] as an offering. Hades, however, betrays Faust and causes him to begin aging rapidly, turning Faust into a withered old man on the spot and claiming to him that "\'\'Ultimately, pain and suffering are all mankind will ever know\'\'". Faust recovers enough to attempt to attack Hades, who was busy fighting Hippolyta and her allies, from behind with a spell, but rather than weaken Hades, it transforms him to his more powerful state. Soon after Wonder Woman destroys the key and sends Hades back to Tartarus, Faust ages into dust and is sucked into the underworld.\n** In the \'\'[[Justice League Unlimited]]\'\' episode "The Balance", [[Tala (comics)|Tala]] manages to recover Felix\'s soul and contain it in a mirror. He tricks Tala into chanting a spell, freeing Faust and trapping Tala in the mirror. Faust then enters and takes control of the Annihilator, an extremely powerful magical automaton forged by the Greek god [[Hephaestus]], taken by the Justice League and then stolen by Cadmus, and uses it to take over Tartarus, overthrowing Hades. This creates a severe unbalance between the realms of the living and the dead. Eventually, Wonder Woman and [[Hawkgirl (animated)|Shayera]] free Hades, and together they destroy the Annihilator and defeat Faust once and for all, leaving Hades to content himself torturing Faust\'s soul forever.\n* Felix Faust appears in \'\'[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]\'\', voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. He had a minor role in the episode "Evil Under the Sea!", where he plotted to open [[Pandora\'s box]] but was defeated by [[Batman]] and [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Atom]]. Felix plays a major role in "The Criss Cross Conspiracy!" as a paroled ex-convict, opening a magic shop. He is seduced by, and helps [[Batwoman]] in swapping bodies with Batman so she can get revenge on the [[Riddler]]. Batman, in Batwoman\'s body, later returns to Faust\'s store and convinces him to escape the police and help him switch back bodies. After Faust, the Riddler, and Batwoman are all arrested, he continues to be smitten by her. In "Triumvirate of Terror", Felix Faust is seen as a member of the [[Legion of Doom]] in a baseball game against the [[Justice League International]].\n* Dee Bradley Baker reprises his role as Felix Faust in the \'\'[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]\'\' episode "Misplaced". He is recruited by [[Klarion the Witch Boy]] to cause a necessary distraction by performing a powerful spell on Roanoke Island alongside him, [[Wizard (DC Comics)|Wizard]], [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]], and [[Blackbriar Thorn]], that splits the world into two dimensions, one for the adults of the world, and one for the children of the world. He and the others are defeated by Red Tornado, Zatara and Batman whilst Klarion is defeated by Doctor Fate and the team.\n* Felix Faust appears in \'\'[[Justice League Action]]\'\', voiced by [[Jon Cryer]].

He succeeds in doing so, but is ultimately defeated by [[Batman]], [[Zatanna]], and [[Etrigan the Demon|Etrigan]]. In "Forget Me Not", he uses a magic orb to erase the memories of all of the Justice League except [[Firestorm (character)|Firestorm]].
