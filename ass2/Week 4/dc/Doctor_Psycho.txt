Peter|Harry G. Peter\'s]] original 1943 design. After DC Comics rebooted its continuity in 1985 (in a publication event known as the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]), Wonder Woman, her supporting characters and many of her foes, were re-imagined and reintroduced. Prior to this reboot, Doctor Psycho demonstrated a command over the occult and was able to harness supernatural energies to project illusions. Since his [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] reintroduction, the character has been presented as an extremely powerful telepath and telekinetic. Despite these changes, Doctor Psycho has consistently been portrayed as a [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] [[Dwarfism|person of short stature]] who suffers from mental illness (ranging from mild obsessiveness to full-blown [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]).\n\nDoctor Psycho made his animation debut as a regular in \'\'[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]\'\', with his voice provided by actor and comedian [[Tony Hale]].\n\n==Background==\nThe character of Doctor Psycho was created by [[William Moulton Marston]], creator of Wonder Woman and author of her original adventures, as an allegory of the folly of abnormal emotions such as misogyny and other hatreds, as well as to be another embodiment of what he called "less actively developed men" (emotionally misaligned) who needed emotional reform by a love leader (Wonder Woman).   [[William Moulton Marston]]\'s creation of Doctor Psycho drew upon his interest in metaphysics and spiritualism.  Marston, a psychologist, created Doctor Psycho as a murderous psychopath with an intense hatred of women. The character was partly inspired by actor [[Lon Chaney]] ("Man of a thousand faces") and partly by Marston\'s undergraduate advisor [[Hugo Münsterberg]], who was opposed to women\'s suffrage and feminism, and was into metaphysics.<ref>{{Cite web | last = Lepore | first = Jill | author-link = Jill Lepore | title = The Last Amazon | magazine = The New Yorker | year = 2014 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/22/last-amazon}}</ref> Doctor Psycho was also one of [[List of Wonder Woman enemies#Cult leaders|several villains]] created for Wonder Woman who were occultists, beguiling the masses for their own self-enriching purposes.\n\nAs Wonder Woman\'s [[List of Wonder Woman enemies|rogues]] and [[List of Wonder Woman supporting characters|supporting cast]] were largely jettisoned during the period that Robert Kanigher wrote and edited the issues, Doctor Psycho remained one of the few villains to appear in the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden]], [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]], and [[Bronze Age of Comics|Bronze Age]] adventures.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=120}}</ref> The character was also one of the few such villains to be modernized in the early issues of the post-\'\'[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\'\' Wonder Woman.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Pre-\'\'Crisis\'\'===\nDoctor Psycho first appears as a pawn of the [[Duke of Deception]].

Bradley removed him as a rival for Marva\'s affections by stealing $125,000 worth of radium from the college lab and hunching down in disguise so that Marva would think she saw her diminutive fiancé as the culprit.\n\nConvicted on the basis of Marva\'s testimony, Psycho seethed behind bars for years, planning his revenge while developing an intense hatred of all women.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=102103}}</ref> Upon his release, he tortured and killed Bradley, who falsely confessed that Marva was his willing accomplice. Psycho then kidnapped and tortured Marva, hypnotically compelling her to marry him, and then subjecting her to daily occult experiments.\n\nLearning that he could use Marva as a medium for summoning ectoplasm he could use at will to fashion and animate human forms around his own misshapen body, he created a new career for himself as an occultist and sham psychic who developed a following of millions.\n\nAt Deception\'s urging, he used his fame as an occultist to campaign for eliminating women from the war effort by creating an ectoplasmic form purporting to be the spirit of [[George Washington]], claiming that women were hindering the war effort. He also disguised himself as Colonel Darnell of Military Intelligence to frame female staff of military intelligence for espionage.\n\nWith the aid of Steve Trevor and the Holliday College girls, Wonder Woman disrupted his plot but was forced to let him go, unable to prove any of his crimes in a court of law.<ref>\'\'Wonder Woman\'\' #5</ref> Doctor Psycho fixated his pathological hatred of women into fantasies of revenge against Wonder Woman.\n\nFreed from Psycho\'s influence, Marva joined the WAACs and helped Wonder Woman expose Nazi saboteur Stoffer, who had disguised himself as General Scott.<ref>\'\'Sensation Comics\'\' #20</ref>\n\nPsycho was eventually imprisoned but escaped by faking his own death, kidnapping Marva and then his former secretary, Joan White, to use as mediums for his ectoplasmic power. He attempted to court Etta Candy in a disguise, but his cover was blown by Etta\'s suitor Oscar Sweetgulper and he was returned to prison.<ref>\'\'Wonder Woman\'\' #18</ref>\n\nIn the Golden Age, Psycho\'s brother [[Ironsides (DC Comics)|Ironsides]] was a brilliant geologist who was also a villain. Ironsides invented the Iron Giant\'s disguise. He did not, however, display any superpowers.\n\nPsycho eventually realized that he could use Steve Trevor as a medium. Kidnapping Trevor, he fashioned an ectoplasmic dream of power from Trevor\'s [[unconscious mind]] and became the powerful \'\'\'"Captain Wonder"\'\'\', who teamed up with the [[Silver Swan (comics)#Pre-Crisis|Silver Swan]] to destroy Wonder Woman. His powerful form was destroyed when Trevor awakened from his slumber.\n\nWhen the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] was testing heroes and villains in the run-up to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], he set up Doctor Psycho to retrieve ectoplasmic machinery from military intelligence and to fight with several of Wonder Woman\'s other rogues, but they were defeated by the combined might of Wonder Woman and [[Etta Candy]], who used the ectoplasm machine to create a superpowered version of herself patterned after Wonder Woman.<ref>\'\'Wonder Woman\'\' #323</ref>\n\n===Post-\'\'Crisis\'\'===\n\'\'Post-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]\'\' Dr. Psycho is introduced as \'\'\'Edgar Cizko\'\'\', a telepath with the ability to enter and sometimes shape other people\'s dreams. <ref>\'\'Wonder Woman\'\' Vol 2 #54</ref> Psycho was enlisted by [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] to create disturbing dreams for Wonder Woman\'s close friend, [[Vanessa Kapatelis]], with the result that Wonder Woman would be forced to separate herself from her closest allies. This was part of a plot intended to leave Wonder Woman isolated and create widespread public fear of her fellow Amazons. Psycho later helps warp Kapatelis\' damaged psyche to turn her into the new [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]].<ref name="dc-ency"/>\n\nDr. Psycho\'s plans are foiled and he subsequently spends some time as a patient in a mental facility, confined to a padded room and a straitjacket. Several members of the time-lost [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] were in telepathic range. When [[Saturn Girl]] mentally shouts for a lost member, this awakened Dr. Psycho enough for him to attack several staff members and flee. The call brought him to the Legion, whom he also attacks.\n\nIn the \'\'[[Villains United]]\'\' miniseries leading up to \'\'[[Infinite Crisis]]\'\', Psycho has surfaced as a core member of [[Lex Luthor]]\'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Working with [[Talia al Ghul]], he recruits many supervillains for the Society, and is rejected and successfully rebuffed by [[Catman (comics)|Catman]]. He threatens to have Catman kill himself. The presence of the man\'s loyal pack of lions convinces Psycho that he might be eaten if he forces Catman to harm himself. This rejection angers him, causing much grumbling for some time afterwards. He also spends time working with Deathstroke in order to capture one of the [[Marvel Family]]. Other members of the Society realize that Psycho is trying to mentally influence them. Unaffected, they brush it off as something to be expected.\n\nAfter the events of the 6th issue of \'\'[[Infinite Crisis]],\'\' Psycho travels with [[Warp (comics)|Warp]] to free [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] from captivity near the center of the Earth. He takes control of Doomsday, and uses him to spearhead [[Battle of Metropolis|a supervillain assault on Metropolis]]. The villains lose this battle.<ref name="dc-ency"/>\n\n[[One Year Later]], Doctor Psycho is arrested and put on trial with [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Kate Spencer]] (Manhunter) as his defense attorney. Following his arrest, he is abandoned by the [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]]. During the trial, he uses his mind-controlling abilities to make Spencer dream of herself dressed as Wonder Woman in a scene reminiscent of the Roman Colosseum. Before the trial verdict could be revealed, his powers are returned to him as a result of his ties to the Society who had constructed the machine that was blocking them. He uses his telepathy to hold the people in the courtroom hostage.\n\nThis forces Spencer to try to put on her uniform but she instead reveals herself to Doctor Psycho as [[Manhunter (comics)|Manhunter]]. Psycho then makes Kate put on her suit, but drops his guard to sneak a kiss with her, resulting in him being stabbed in the stomach and head. This causes him to forget about Kate\'s alter-ego and lose his powers.\n\nDoctor Psycho has lately been shown still in a position of authority with the Society in the \'\'[[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]\'\' miniseries.

Because of this disagreement, he left the C.I.A. project and joined the "Hairies" on The Farm in New York, where he conducted his experiments on people with the chemicals developed by him in his lab, but their experiments went awry, turning them into wild, violent creatures, disgusting [[Bekka]], the Wonder Woman. Thanks to Bekka\'s crystal gems created by her [[Mother Box]], Doctor Psycho advanced in his experiments, but his misrepresented goals turned people in his lab into monsters. Despite this he founded The Eternity Institute in [[Switzerland]] and all he\'d achievedthe extraordinary advances in science, medicine and technologyover the next forty years Alpert became a notorious recluse, never being seen in public and secretly harvesting DNA of the [[Justice League]]. He was the one who created the [[Forever People]], claiming to be the result of his efforts to develop humanity and lead them to a new world of peace and order, devoting to wipe out disease, poverty and war. But beneath all a veneer of goodness and altruism lay the essence of a greedy man, and in his dying days, evolved into [[Imperiex]] using DNA of the League and the Forever Formula.
