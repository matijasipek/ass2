This gave him the right arm and leg of a plant, the left arm and leg of diamonds, and a half-torso of a [[Tyrannosaurus]] with half of his human head shown to be fused with part of the Tyrannosaurus\' neck.

His team is working to discredit the Doom Patrol, having been coached in various ways on how to make the heroes look bad for the cameras. Unknown to the Front Men, [[Mr. Nobody (comics)|Mister Somebody]] has rigged their uniforms to deliver fatal blows in ways that make it seem as if the Doom Patrol killed them intentionally.<ref>\'\'The Doom Patrol\'\' Vol 5 #12 (September 2010)</ref>\n\nIn 2011, "[[The New 52]]" rebooted the DC universe.

He gained a reputation there where he ate their foes.<ref>\'\'Doomsday Clock\'\' #5 (May 2018).

He is among the Doom Patrol villains (alongside [[Brain (DC Comics)|Brain]], [[Monsieur Mallah]], Mutant Master, and Arsenal) assembled by [[General Zahl]] to target the Doom Patrol. He attacks the carnival that Negative Man works at with the carnival barker asking about him and wondering who his agent is. [[Batman]] and the other Doom Patrol members arrive, and Negative Man helps them fend off Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man. He later appears on General Zahl\'s ship with the other villains and ends up defeated by Batman.\n* Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man makes an appearance in the third episode of \'\'[[Doom Patrol (TV series)|Doom Patrol]]\'\', played by [[Alec Mapa]]. This version is a tourist in [[Paraguay]] named \'\'\'Steven Larson\'\'\' who travels to Fuchtopia in hopes to be given superpowers – "magnetic feet", specifically – via a machine built by Sturmbannführer Von Fuchs. His transformation into Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man is shown at the end of the episode when he accidentally stays in the machine too long. The outcome gave him a human head and a separate [[Velociraptor]] head, rather than the combined head of the comic version. A running joke throughout the season involved various news updates on Larson\'s activities including a disastrous convenience store robbery, a subsequent arrest, and a failed assassination attempt on his life by an admirer of von Fuchs. In season 2, there\'s an advertisement for Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man\'s [[autobiography]] called \'\'My Side\'\' which is cited as a "America\'s new, bestselling autobiography".\n\n===Media tie-in comics===\n* Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man had a cameo appearance in issue #28 of \'\'[[Teen Titans Go! (2004 comic series)|Teen Titans Go!]]\'\'. The Doom Patrol discuss a battle they (along with a younger [[Beast Boy]]) had with Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man. He makes a full appearance on page 10, which itself is based on the cover of the \'\'[[Doom Patrol]]\'\' comic.\n* Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man made a cameo appearance in issue #7 in the \'\'[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]\'\' tie-in comic and the cartoon series.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Animal-Vegetable-Mineral_Man Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man] at DC Database\n\n{{Doom Patrol}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Arnold Drake]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:DC Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who are shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics hybrids]]\n[[Category:Doom Patrol]]\n[[Category:Fictional biologists]]\n[[Category:Fictional Swedish people]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]'}]}}}}
