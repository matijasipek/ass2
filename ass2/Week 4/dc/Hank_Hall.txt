Hawk represented "chaos", while Dove represented "order". His brother Don Hall died during \'\'[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\'\' and was replaced with Dawn Granger.<ref name="dc-exta"/>\n\n===\'\'Armageddon 2001:\'\' Monarch===\n{{main|Monarch (comics)}}\n\'\'\'Monarch\'\'\' was an oppressive tyrant from a bleak, dystopian Earth fifty years in the future. The people were unhappy with his rule, particularly a scientist named [[Waverider (comics)|Matthew Ryder]], an expert on [[Time|temporal]] studies, who was convinced he could use his technology to travel back in time and prevent the maniacal ruler from ever coming to power. He learned that forty years ago, one of Earth\'s strongest and most powerful heroes would eventually turn evil and become Monarch, and ten years from that event he would conquer the world. During a time travel experiment, Matthew was transformed into a being called "Waverider", and began searching the timestream for the hero who would become Monarch, not knowing that Monarch was following him. When Monarch came into battle with the heroes of the present day, he killed Dove, and her enraged partner killed him for it. Removing the villain\'s mask, Hank discovered that he was Monarch, and donned the armor.<ref name="dc-exta"/>\n\nThe reveal of Hank Hall as Monarch led to some [[Armageddon 2001#Response_and_last-minute_changes|controversy]] amongst the fan community; Monarch was originally intended to be revealed as Captain Atom, with clues in the story pointing towards this which had to be discarded when it was changed at the last minute. This change was due to the premature leaking of Monarch\'s identity. While Monarch was always supposed to be Captain Atom, this was supposed to be a secret. When Monarch\'s identity was prematurely leaked, DC decided to preserve the surprise of the story by switching Monarch\'s identity to that of Hank Hall.\n\nAs many fans pointed out, \'\'Hawk and Dove\'\' (vol. 3) Annual #2 had Hank Hall fighting Monarch face to face in 2001 with Hawk being the destroyer of Monarch.<ref>\'\'Hawk and Dove\'\' (vol. 3) Annual #2 pp. 9-19</ref> Dove allowed Waverider to see a multitude of futures and realize Hawk is Monarch.\n\n===\'\'Armageddon: The Alien Agenda\'\'===\nWhen hostile aliens encounter Monarch and [[Captain Atom]] in the past (sometime between 230 and 65 million years ago), they attempt to enlist both (with each figure having no knowledge of the other involved) to assist them in creating a wormhole. The wormhole\'s creation would destroy the universe in which the primitive Earth existed, but would allow the aliens to travel freely.\n\n===\'\'Zero Hour:\'\' Extant===\n{{main|Zero Hour (comics)}}\n[[File:Extant (Hank Hall).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hank Hall as Extant during \'\'Zero Hour\'\', art by Eric Battle.]]\nShortly after returning to the present, Monarch confronted Waverider and used his power to see the past and future to become aware of the power within him. It is explained at this point, that when Monarch killed Dove, her powers went directly into Hawk. Realising this, Monarch unleashes his hidden powers and becomes \'\'\'Extant\'\'\'.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=103}}</ref> Extant then removes Waverider\'s timetravel device and joins forces with renegade [[Green Lantern]] [[Hal Jordan]], now known as [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], in a plan to alter time as they saw fit.<ref name="dc-exta"/>\n\nHis first act was to alter the future so that he could have a [[metahuman]] army at his disposal, mostly consisting of members of the [[Teen Titans]]; his plan was to amass an army so powerful that no one could interfere with his efforts to control time itself. Several armies of heroes banded together to stop his plans before they began in the 30th century, and altered history so that his followers never came to exist in the future.\n\nDown, but not out, Extant began to strike back at the heroes at Ground Zero, the beginning of time. Parallax had warped several metahumans from various time periods together for the ultimate assault, and Extant hit the Atom with a chronal blast, de-aging him into a teenager. Sensing defeat was imminent, he escaped the fight, promising vengeance at a later date.\n\nExtant would first reappear in the 1999 one-shot "Impulse: Bart Saves the Universe".<ref>\'\'Impulse: Bart Saves the Universe\'\', DC Comics (1999)</ref> In it, Extant picks a fight with the original [[Justice Society]] as a means of tricking the [[Linear Men]] into saving the life of an innocent bystander who was destined to die. The man they saved would now go on to develop a nuclear weapon that, when tested, would shift the Earth out of its proper orbit, causing massive changes in the timelines of some of Earth\'s greatest heroes. Among these changes, Hal Jordan never becomes Green Lantern, thus he never becomes Parallax, and never stops Extant from destroying all of time. Fortunately for the citizens of time, [[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]] arrives and is barely able to defeat Extant and prevent the Linear Men from saving the doomed scientist.\n\nHe would engage the Justice Society again on a later date as he sought to acquire the reality-warping power of the Worlogog, recently dismantled by [[Hourman (android)|Hourman]] because he feared its power. Although Extant succeeded in his goal with the aid of [[Metron (comics)|Metron]]\'s stolen Mobius Chair, [[Hector Hall|Doctor Fate]] learned from the imprisoned [[Mordru]] that when Hourman had dismantled the Worlogog, he had retained a small fragment of it, thus creating infinitesimal flaw in the prime Worlogog that the JSA could exploit.\n\nAfter the resurrected Dove sacrificed herself to distract Extant, Hourman divided his Hour of Power amongst his teammates, thus granting them all immunity to Extant\'s reality warping powers for four minutes, each of them attacking him on a different temporal plane until they were able to separate him from the Worlogog. Following this setback, Extant again attempted to escape. Instead, Extant was teleported by Hourman and Metron, at [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]]\'s behest, into the seat of an airplane whose crash [[Kobra (DC comics)|Kobra]] had caused earlier (in his relative timestream). As a result of this, Atom Smasher\'s mother was saved (as she was on the plane when it crashed), but Atom Smasher replaced his mother with a weakened Extant, saving her life but murdering the super villain to stop his threat and ensure that the same number of people died on that plane who had died originally.\n\n===Hawk restored===\nIn response to fan-criticism of \'\'[[Armageddon 2001]]\'\', many of whose readers felt that the character of Hawk had been severely misused in the story\'s [[Armageddon 2001#Response and last-minute changes|last-minute changes]], DC Comics set about restoring the character as he had originally been intended; a hero. DC had already [[retcon]]ned Extant\'s portion of Hank Hall\'s timeline in issue 14 of \'\'[[Justice Society of America#JSA .281999.E2.80.932006.29|JSA]]\'\', dated September 2000, in which [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] announced his intention to erase the villain\'s "wretched timeline" with his Mobius Chair. This was the second issue of a 3-part story entitled \'\'The Hunt for Extant!\'\' (the details of which are listed above). After this, DC also retconned Monarch\'s portion of Hall\'s timeline with the final issue of the 6-part miniseries [[Blüdhaven#The Battle for Bl.C3.BCdhaven|The Battle for Blüdhaven]], dated September 2006, which now depicted [[Captain Atom]]\'s transformation into Monarch, as had been DC\'s original intention back in 1991. Hawk was restored, but he would not be revived until the final issue of \'\'[[Blackest Night]]\'\'.\n\n===\'\'Blackest Night\'\'===\n[[File:Hawk WhiteL-.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hank Hall as the resurrected [[White Lantern Corps|White Lantern]] Hawk from \'\'Birds of Prey\'\' #4, art by [[Ryan Sook]].]]\nIn the \'\'[[Blackest Night]]\'\' crossover, Hank Hall is reanimated as a member of the undead [[Black Lantern Corps]].

However, he failed to catch the boomerang and instead it was caught by Boston Brand, who ended up dying in the process and used his final act to move his white power ring to Alec Holland and bring back the Swamp Thing in order to cleanse the Green of Nekron\'s influence.<ref>\'\'Brightest Day\'\' #24</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs Hawk he possessed a "danger sense transformation" which allowed him to change into a super-human with the powers of super strength, unlimited stamina, enhanced speed, increased agility, enhanced body density, extreme durability and healing factor. \n\nHis partner Dove suppresses his violent nature, and without her Hank\'s rage becomes boundless.\n\nAs Monarch he possessed the same powers that he had as Hawk, along with a suit of highly durable armor that was crafted using advanced technology.\n\nAs Extant he had the powers of chronokinesis, energy projection, flight, and omniscience. After piecing together the Worlogog he became nigh-omnipotent.\n\nWhile he was a member of the Black Lantern Corps, Hank wielded a black power ring which allowed him to generate black energy constructs. He was also able to perceive emotional auras. Whilst he was able to perceive Holly\'s aura as red for rage, he saw Dawn\'s as a pure white that his ring could not identify. While wearing the black power ring it lowers his original power by over 50%.\n\n==Other versions==\n* In the [[Elseworlds]] \'\'[[JLA: The Nail]]\'\' miniseries, and its sequel \'\'[[JLA: Another Nail]]\'\', a version of Hank Hall exists, alongside the original Dove.\n* \'\'Justice League of America\'\' (vol. 2) #26 features an alternate reality created by the trickster god [[Anansi]]. In this reality, an armored version of Hawk is seen.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Hank Hall as Hawk appears in \'\'[[Justice League Unlimited]]\'\', voiced by [[Fred Savage]]. This version is depicted with a strong relationship with his brother Dove (Don Hall). In their self-titled episode, their fighting styles were thoroughly contrasted; Hawk employs brute-force, aggressive tactics, at times resembling a [[American football|football]] player while Dove uses a blend of techniques reminiscent of [[aikido]] or judo, using his attacker\'s movements to fling aside. After defeating some thugs in a bar, Hawk and Dove are enlisted by [[Wonder Woman]] to help stop [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] from causing war in [[Kaznia]]. They are successful due to Dove\'s peaceful resistance against the rage-powered Annihilator. The brothers are last seen in the series finale "Destroyer" where they fight off [[Parademon]]s alongside several other Justice League members. They later appear in the final scene running down the steps of the Metro Tower, along with Steve Ditko\'s fellow creations: the [[Question (comics)|Question]], the [[Creeper (comics)|Creeper]] and [[Captain Atom]].  \n* Hank Hall as Hawk appears in \'\'[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]\'\', voiced by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]. In the teaser for "When OMAC Attacks", he and Dove help [[Batman]] stop an intergalactic war between the [[Controllers (DC Comics)|Controllers]] and the Warlords of Okaara, but both have different approaches to this matter, escalating in their bickering and fight. Regardless, Batman gets the two sides\' leaders to sign the peace treaty and end the war. They also briefly appear in the two-part episode "The Siege of Starro" amongst the heroes who were taken over by [[Starro]], but they are later back to normal.\n* Hank Hall as Hawk appears in \'\'[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]\'\', portrayed by [[Alan Ritchson]], with Tait Blum as a younger version of the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdist.com/vepisode/exclusive-which-dc-characters-will-be-on-tnts-the-titans/|title=Exclusive: Which DC Characters Will Be On TNT\'s The Titans|publisher=Nerdist|last=Diaz|first=Eric|date=February 2, 2015|access-date=February 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202210414/http://www.nerdist.com/vepisode/exclusive-which-dc-characters-will-be-on-tnts-the-titans/|archive-date=February 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/09/titans-alan-ritchson-hawk-dc-live-action-series-1202163748/|title=\'\'Titans\'\': Alan Ritchson Cast As Hawk In DC Live-Action Series|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=September 7, 2017|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Instead of being depicted as having superpowers, Hank\'s physical prowess is as a football player. In the series, Hank and his half-brother Don Hall are the original Hawk and Dove team that hunt down sexual predators, motivated by abuse that Hank\'s football coach inflicted on him as a child. After Don is killed in the same accident that kills Dawn Granger\'s mother, Hank has a romantic pairing with Dawn while subsequently being Hawk and Dove respectively. Ritchson left the series with the [[Titans (season 3)|third season]], where [[Jason Todd]]—under the influence of [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]—implants a bomb into Hank and manipulates Dawn into detonating it. Hank helps [[Donna Troy]] and [[Tim Drake]] escape from the afterlife before reuniting with Don.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/tv/titans-alan-ritchson-exit-hank-death/ |title=\'\'Titans star\'\' on character\'s \'beautiful\' exit: \'The decision was made for me, and it was for the best\' |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |date=September 23, 2021 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=September 29, 2021}}</ref>\n** Ritchson also appear in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \'\'[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\'\'.
