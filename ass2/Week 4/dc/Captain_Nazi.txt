Nazi first appeared in \'\'[[Master Comics]]\'\' #21 (December 1941), in opposition to both Captain Marvel and [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl|Bulletman]].<ref>\'\'Master Comics\'\' #21. Fawcett Comics.</ref> During the second half of his battle with Marvel in \'\'Whiz Comics\'\' #25 (published the same month), Nazi attacks two innocent bystanders who happened to be fishing near the scene of the battle, after they pull him out of the lake, and he escapes in their boat. One of them, an old man named Jacob Freeman, is killed, but the old man\'s teenage grandson Freddy Freeman is saved by Captain Marvel. Although he is crippled and his back broken with a hit from an oar while Nazi escapes in the boat. Due to Captain Marvel bestowing part of his power to him, Freddy becomes [[Captain Marvel Jr.]] He is then sent to defeat Captain Nazi by Captain Marvel.<ref>\'\'Whiz Comics\'\' #25. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nJunior, crippled in his Freddy Freeman form by the attack, continues to hold a vendetta against Nazi, and the two frequently battle one another. Nazi also serves as a member of [[Mister Mind]]\'s [[Monster Society of Evil]], one of the most powerful organisations of villains in the world which included Adolf Hitler, and assists their first plan to steal magic fortune-telling pearls from a princess, leading Captain Marvel to their hideout, and revealing their existence, during the World War II years, before making his final Fawcett Comics appearance in the story "General Nippon\'s Elusive Earthplane", published in \'\'Captain Marvel, Jr.\'\' #19 in 1944.\n\n===DC Comics===\n[[Image:Power-of-shazam-19.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Captain Marvel, Jr. and Captain Nazi on the cover of \'\'[[The Power of Shazam!]]\'\' #19 (1996). Art by [[Jerry Ordway]].]]\n\nCaptain Nazi appeared only sporadically in [[DC Comics]]\' 1970s/1980s revival of the [[Marvel Family]] characters under the title \'\'Shazam!\'\', save for reprints of the original Fawcett stories. Nazi\'s first appearance in a new DC Comics story was in \'\'Shazam!\'\' #34 (March- April 1978).\n\nFollowing writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Tom Mandrake]]\'s new interpretation of the Captain Marvel mythos in the 1987 four-issue miniseries \'\'[[Shazam!: The New Beginning]]\'\', Captain Nazi was re-introduced in a 1988 four-part story in \'\'[[Action Comics Weekly#Action Comics Weekly .281988-1989.29|Action Comics Weekly]]\'\' issues #623-626. Captain Nazi himself, however, only appeared in #624-626. The story was written by Thomas and his wife [[Dann Thomas]], with art by Rick Stasi and Rick Magyar. The new Captain Nazi is a young Neo-Nazi named Lester Abernathy. Abernathy is given his "Captain Nazi" powers, costume and codename by a Neo-Nazi organization called the Sons of [[Valhalla]] and battles Captain Marvel.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.comics.org/issue/45162/ | title = \'\'Action Comics Weekly\'\' #623 | publisher = Grand Comics Database | date =| website = comics.org| accessdate =}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.comics.org/issue/45178/ | title = \'\'Action Comics Weekly\'\' #624 | publisher = Grand Comics Database | date =| website = comics.org| accessdate =}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.comics.org/issue/45295/ | title = \'\'Action Comics Weekly\'\' #625 | publisher = Grand Comics Database | date =| website = comics.org| accessdate =}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.comics.org/issue/45299/ | title = \'\'Action Comics Weekly\'\' #626 | publisher = Grand Comics Database | date =| website = comics.org| accessdate =}}</ref> This version of the character made no further appearances and was subsequently [[retcon]]ned out of existence by the 1994 \'\'The Power of Shazam!\'\' graphic novel, which again altered Captain Marvel\'s background and continuity.\n\nCaptain Nazi was introduced into the modern [[DC Universe]] in [[Jerry Ordway]]\'s \'\'The Power of Shazam!\'\' series in 1995. In the modern series, Nazi had been active during the 1940s, battling World War II-era heroes such as Bulletman, [[Minute-Man]], and [[Spy Smasher]], but placed himself in suspended animation in a chamber so that he could emerge in modern society and revive the [[Third Reich]]. He believed Hitler\'s body to be held in a similar chamber. Nazi\'s brother, scientist Wolf Krieger, and his granddaughter, a super-powered villainess named Madame Libertine who possesses mind-controlling powers, carry on Nazi\'s legacy in the 1990s and resurrect their hero from his suspended animation chamber in \'\'The Power of Shazam!\'\' #5.<ref name="dc-ency"/>\n\nIssues #6–8 of \'\'The Power of Shazam\'\' series retell the story of Captain Nazi\'s murdering Freddy\'s grandfather by throwing him a great distance with his superhuman strength, his crippling of Freddy, and Freddy\'s emergence as Marvel, Jr. and attempted revenge on Nazi. His life was actually saved by Freddy who believed the figure who fell into the lake was Captain Marvel, who had just knocked him into the lake. After the Marvel Family captures and defeats Nazi, he is sent to [[Europe]] to be tried for war crimes committed during World War II.<ref>\'\'The Power of Shazam\'\' #6–8. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nCaptain Nazi eventually joins Lex Luthor\'s new [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] as seen in the miniseries \'\'[[Villains United]]\'\' where he works with them to torture the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. He is blinded during the escape of the Secret Six when [[Catman (comics)|Catman]] plunges syringes into his eyes.\n\nCaptain Nazi meets his apparent end in \'\'[[Batman]]\'\' #647 while fighting Batman and the [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]]. The Captain, now sporting cybernetic eyes following his injury in \'\'Villains United\'\', has been lent out to the villain [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] to assassinate the Red Hood alongside fellow Society members [[Deathstroke]], Count Vertigo, and [[Hyena (comics)|Hyena]]. During the fight, the Red Hood apparently kills Captain Nazi by jamming a [[taser]]-like weapon into his cybernetic eyes (the only vulnerable part of his body).<ref>\'\'Batman\'\' #647. DC Comics.</ref> In \'\'Villains United Special\'\' #1 however, Nazi has survived. At the behest of the Society, Nazi appeared in [[Kahndaq]] to release all of the captives in its prisons and fights Khandaq\'s ruler and former Secret Society member, [[Black Adam]]. During the battle, Black Adam confronts Nazi about how he seemingly survived being killed, at which time Captain Nazi cryptically proclaims that previous origins about him were wrong and that the villain is not even human; that he is the living avatar of National Socialism given physical form and that so long as there are Nazis in existence, he will exist. Captain Nazi was able to stalemate Black Adam in the battle afterwards.<ref>\'\'Villains United Special\'\' #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n\nHe has since appeared as leader of a Nazi-themed team in \'\'[[Justice Society of America]]\'\' named "The Fourth Reich" after the "[[One Year Later]]" jump, and is an opponent of [[Wonder Woman]] in "The Circle", sporting a generic black costume.\n\nIn September 2011, DC Comics engaged in a line-wide revision of its superhero comics, including their stories and characters\' fictional histories, known as \'\'[[The New 52]]\'\'. In the new stories, Captain Nazi first appears in the "Superman" storyline "Savage Dawn" in \'\'Superman\'\' (vol. 3) Annual #3. In 1941, Captain Nazi is genetically engineered to serve in Hitler\'s Aerospace program. [[Vandal Savage]] successfully convinces the [[Third Reich]] to build a rocket that Captain Nazi will use to pilot himself and Vandal Savage into outer space to collect a larger sample of the meteor that gave Savage his powers. When the ship faces turbulence, Captain Nazi opts to land instead of going forward with the mission. After a crash landing, an enraged Vandal Savage beats him until he stops moving.<ref>\'\'Superman\'\' (vol. 3) Annual #3. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===Flashpoint===\nIn the alternate timeline of the \'\'[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\'\' event, Captain Nazi is a member of the [[H.I.V.E.]] council and represents Germany. He voted for using nuclear weapons to end the war in Western Europe between Aquaman and Wonder Woman. He appears much older here, possibly because he was not placed in suspended animation.<ref>\'\'Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint\'\' #1 (June 2011). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n* In an episode of the TV show \'\'[[Justice League Unlimited]],\'\' Captain Nazi made a round-about appearance. During a flashback sequence, a character who looks very similar to Captain Nazi is prevented from taking a super-soldier serum by [[Fawcett Comics]] hero [[Spy Smasher]]. It is later revealed that the serum was created for "\'\'\'Project Captain Nazi\'\'\'". [[General Wade Eiling]] broke into [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus Labs]] and injected himself with the serum. He then went on a rampage in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Seeking a battle with [[Superman]], Eiling was instead confronted by seven members of the [[Justice League]]: [[Green Arrow]], [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]], [[Pat Dugan|S.T.R.I.P.E.]], [[Shining Knight]], [[Vigilante (comics)#Greg Saunders|Vigilante]] and the [[Crimson Avenger (Lee Travis)|Crimson Avenger]] (the line-up was roughly equivalent to that of DC Comics\' [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] team "the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]]").<ref name="jlunlimited">{{cite episode|title=Patriot Act|series=Justice League Unlimited|series-link=Justice League Unlimited|credits=[[Matt Wayne]] (writer); [[Joaquim Dos Santos]] (director)|network=[[Cartoon Network]]|airdate=2006-02-25|season=3|number=7}}</ref>\n* In an episode of the TV show \'\'[[Legends of Tomorrow]]\'\', [[André Eriksen]] portrayed Baron Krieger in the second season episode "The Justice Society of America". He is an ally of [[Eobard Thawne]] and acquired a sample of a biomolecular enhancer (the same that changed [[Nate Heywood]] into Steel) from the Reverse Flash to transform into a bezerker-monstrous self-proclaimed "[[Übermensch]]" to fight the [[Justice Society|JSA]] and the time-travelling Legends. He was defeated by Nate and his grandfather Commander Steel/Henry Heywood.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110128135717/http://marvelfamily.com/whoswho/whoswho.aspx?castID=19 Captain Nazi\'s "Who\'s Who" file] at The Marvel Family Web\n\n{{Shazam}}\n\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:DC Comics male supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fawcett Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional military captains|Nazi]]\n[[Category:DC Comics Nazis]]\n[[Category:DC Comics neo-Nazis]]\n[[Category:Golden Age supervillains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1941]]\n[[Category:National personifications in comic books]]\n[[Category:Captain Marvel (DC Comics)]]\n\n[[de:Captain Marvel (DC Comics)#Captain Nazi]]'}]}}}}
