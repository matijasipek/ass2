The experience drives the Floronic Man insane; he refers to himself as "Wood-Rue", and sets out to destroy all non-plant life on Earth by forcing the plants to produce an excess amount of oxygen to force humans and animals into extinction, in the belief that he is "saving" Earth from mankind. Woodrue is confronted by a revived Swamp Thing, who reveals to the Green that plants cannot survive without humans and animals, as his actions would deprive them of the carbon dioxide that \'\'they\'\' require to breathe that comes from humans and animals, forcing Woodrue to acknowledge that his actions are the actions of a man rather than a plant.

Regenerating a plant body, he begins his quest to flood the streets of Gotham City with his advanced and cheap pot. The Floronic Man takes some of Poison Ivy\'s DNA in an attempt to create a "child". Poison Ivy, in exchange, gets a trunk full of dope money, and is free to walk away. Deciding that she does not want the Floronic Man running the world, she frees the Batman.

When a plane carrying members of Ivy University science faculty lands on his island as part of a plan to establish a research center, the Plant Master uses his special plants to knock them out and have his henchmen capture them. When the Atom arrives, he takes out the Plant Master\'s henchmen before being captured by the Plant Master and his pet cat. The Plant Master then places the Atom in a container where he is strangled by living grass that the Plant Master activated. With some unknowing help from the Plant Master\'s cat, the Atom was able to defeat the Plant Master, where he and his henchmen are arrested by the Coast Guard.\n* Dr. Woodrue is referenced several times in the 1990s \'\'[[Swamp Thing: The Series|Swamp Thing]]\'\' series.

When at the Conclave facility, Woodrue deduces and reveals to him that he is not Alec Holland but a humanoid plant that absorbed Holland\'s memories after the explosion that killed Holland. After the Swamp Thing is freed by Abby Arcane and Liz Tremayne with some help from [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]], Woodrue escapes with organs.
