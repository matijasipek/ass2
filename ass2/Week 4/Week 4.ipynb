This transformation also extends to the items that Creel was wearing and carrying when Loki\\'s potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal [[titanium]], his body, clothes, and wrecking ball takes on its appearance and properties). He can absorb sufficient mass of a large object (e.g., a building) to attain the same height.
