This transformation also extends to the items that Creel was wearing and carrying when Loki\\'s potion took effect (for example, if Creel touches the metal [[titanium]], his body, clothes, and wrecking ball takes on its appearance and properties). He can absorb sufficient mass of a large object (e.g., a building) to attain the same height. While in different altered forms, he still maintains his intellect, capacity for speech, and full physical movement (although his first attempt at absorbing water temporarily cost Creel\\'s sanity when he tried to keep himself from drifting apart in the ocean).<ref name=\"Avengers #184 July 1979\" /> His body was able to reform itself after being broken or damaged,<ref>\\'\\'The Incredible Hulk\\'\\' Vol 2 #456-457 (September-October 1997)</ref> especially a severed arm which [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] cuts off during the \\'\\'[[Secret Wars]]\\'\\'.<ref>\\'\\'Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars\\'\\' #7 (Nov. 1984).
