DC Comics, however, was not interested in their pitch, believing the show\'s and the [[martial arts]] genre popularity would phase out quickly. The duo then approached [[Marvel Comics]] with the idea to create a [[kung fu]]-focused original comic. Editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] agreed, but only if they would include the [[Sax Rohmer]]\'s pulp villain [[Dr. Fu Manchu]], as Marvel had previously acquired the comic book rights to the character.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inside Shang-Chi\'s evolution from forgotten comic book character to big-screen superhero |url=https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/09/04/entertainment/shang-chi-marvel-comics-history-cec/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=March 3, 2001 |title=A success written in the stars |url=https://universohq.com/english/jim-starlin-success-written-stars/ |access-date=September 8, 2021 |publisher=[[Universo HQ]]}}</ref> Englehart and Starlin developed [[Shang-Chi]], a master of kung fu and a previously unknown son of Dr. Fu Manchu.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanderson |first1=Peter |title=Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History |last2=Gilbert |first2=Laura |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0756641238 |location=London, United Kingdom |page=161 |chapter=1970s |quote=Capitalizing on the popularity of martial arts movies, writer Steve Englehart and artist/co-plotter Jim Starlin created Marvel\'s \'\'Master of Kung Fu\'\' series.

The [[Ancient One]], a fellow sorcerer and friend, provided the brothers the Eyes of the Dragon, a pair of stones that granted longevity and vigor while requiring the sacrifice of another. By 1860, the brothers had aged decades beyond their natural lifespans through the use of longevity spells and had grown weaker as a result. During the [[Second Opium War]], the Society fought against [[British Armed Forces|British forces]], but were defeated by [[Dormammu]] and the [[Mindless Ones]] summoned by the British sorcerer Baron Harkness, resulting in the death of the Deadly Warriors. Zu attempted to use the Eyes of the Dragon to save the fatally wounded Yi at the cost of his own life, but not wanting to rule the Society alone, Yi reversed the spell, granting Zu immortality and restoring his youth, giving him the power to defeat the combined British forces. Following the death of his brother and the Deadly Warriors, Zu led the Society alone, establishing five houses in their honor. Without his brother\'s guidance, Zu lost his way, becoming increasingly bitter and ruthless. After losing one of the houses during the [[Boxer Rebellion]], Zu renounced his country and followers for their perceived weakness and lied about his brother\'s death, claiming he killed him for being weak as well and stole his spirit energy to augment his own. Zu subsequently relocated four of the Society\'s five houses to foreign countries within the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] to monitor those who had fought against China and the Society during the conflict.<ref name="auto1">\'\'Shang-Chi\'\' #1.

Within the first few years into his marriage, Zheng Zu grew to genuinely love his family.<ref>\'\'Shang-Chi\'\' (vol. 2) #7 Marvel Comics</ref> However following an attack by [[Hydra_(comics)|Hydra]] against the House of the Deadly Hand, Zu became cold and distant towards his family, as he felt that his love for them made him weak, and resumed his plans to infiltrate Ta Lo. Xin and Jiang Li confronted Zu in his personal tower, where they discovered he had constructed a makeshift portal to Ta Lo. While Zu fought his wife and father-in-law, Shang-Chi happened upon the scene, just as the portal\'s connection to Ta Lo became disconnected and Jiang Li was accidentally pushed through, sending her to the [[Negative Zone]]. Zu and Xin blamed each other for Jiang Li\'s presumed death and each tried convincing Shang-Chi to join them. Shang-Chi sided with his father and threw one of Zu\'s chemicals at Xin\' face, blinding and leaving a scar across his right eye. Xin denounced Shang-Chi to be as evil as his father and fled on his [[Qilin]]. Zu subsequently placed a memory spell on Shang-Chi, making him forget the incident.<ref>\'\'Shang-Chi\'\' (vol. 2) #8 Marvel Comics</ref> \n\nDuring their childhood, Shang-Chi and Shi-Hua accidentally discovered one of their father\'s secret laboratories in his [[Hunan]] retreat. As punishment, their father told Shang-Chi that he gave Shi-Hua a merciful death, explaining that the luxury of human bonds was weakness. In truth, he secretly sent Shi-Hua to the House of the Deadly Hammer in [[Russia]]. Shang-Chi would continue to be raised in isolation in his father\'s Hunan retreat; unbeknownst to Shang-Chi, the Hunan retreat was the House of the Deadly Hand, with Shang-Chi chosen to be its champion.<ref name="auto">\'\'Shang-Chi\'\' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nLike with Shang-Chi and Shi-Hua, their father selected several of his other children to be raised in the Society\'s other Houses as their respective champions, with daughter Zheng Zhilan<ref name=":1">\'\'Shang-Chi\'\' (vol. 2) #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> and an unnamed son at the House of the Deadly Staff in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], son Takeshi at the House of the Deadly Sabre in [[Japan]] and daughter [[Sister Dagger|Esme]] at the House of the Deadly Dagger in [[France]]. When Zhilan voiced her plans to reform the Society, Zheng Zu ordered Takeshi to assassinate her, who instead chose to spare her and helped fake her death. Unbeknownst to both, their father ordered her death due to her status as a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], whom Zu believed were colonial threats.<ref name=":1" /> \n\nTony McKay and Sir Denis Nayland Smith later launched an attack on the Si-Fan,<ref>As told in \'\'Emperor Fu Manchu\'\' (1959) by [[Sax Rohmer]]</ref> after which Zheng Zu captured both of them, killed McKay with a "hellish green liquid" that \'took six seconds" to accomplish and used his Japanese sumo wrestler bodyguard Tak to cripple Smith by crushing his legs.

Upon finding a disfigured infant named [[Midnight Sun (Marvel Comics)|M\'Nai]] after also finding his parents dead, Zheng Zu decided that he could shape M\'Nai into a powerful servant and M\'Nai was raised alongside Shang-Chi.

Shang-Chi was successful in killing Petrie and was confronted by Nayland Smith, who told Shang-Chi the truth about his father.

Aloysius Thorndrake of the [[Shadow Council]] had somehow partially resurrected Shang-Chi\'s father, whose real name was revealed to be Zheng Zu (with "Zheng Zu" being one of his many aliases) as the Shadow Council agents are digging for the Eyes of the Dragon. Max Fury (a rogue [[Life Model Decoy]] of [[Nick Fury]]) then reports to Aloysius that they have found the Eyes of the Dragon.

The Prince of Orphans disrupts the ritual, causing Zheng Zu to turn to stone, which the Prince of Orphans then shatters.<ref>\'\'Secret Avengers\'\' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWith Zu\'s death, the title of Supreme Commander of the Five Weapons Society was passed down to his son, Brother Staff. Believing that the Society had been reduced to a "glorified drug ring" under Staff\'s leadership, Shi-Hua, now known as Sister Hammer, challenges him at the House of the Deadly Staff in London to usurp control of the Society. Despite Hammer defeating and mortally wounding Staff, Zheng Zu\'s spirit selects Shang-Chi as the new Supreme Commander instead of Hammer. An enraged Hammer assumes control of the Society and sends the Warriors of the Deadly Staff to kill her brother in America.<ref name="auto1"/> When Shang-Chi is poisoned by Shi-Hua, a dilapidated spirit resembling Zheng Zu commands him to awaken.<ref name="auto"/> While Shang-Chi is recuperating at the House of the Deadly Dagger in [[France]], the same spirit beckons him to the House\'s shrine room.

When Shang-Chi is named the new Supreme Commander of the Five Weapons Society, Zheng Zu\'s spirit congratulates him, remarking that he is destined to become like him.<ref>\'\'Shang-Chi\'\' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\nWhile imprisoned in the Jade Palace dungeon in Ta Lo, Zheng Zu\'s spirit visits Shang-Chi to convince him to take the Ten Rings to stop Xin, who kidnapped Jiang Li (who was released from the Negative Zone by Shang-Chi) and plans to destroy their family. Xin, empowered by a \'\'taotie\'\' mask created from Shang-Chi\'s blood and Shi-Hua\'s severed hand, arrives at the dungeon to destroy the Zheng bloodline once and for all. Shang-Chi reluctantly allows his father to guide him to the Jade Emperor\'s vault containing the Ten Rings, donning them to save his siblings from his grandfather.<ref name=":0" /> While fighting Xin, Shang-Chi realizes that Zu\'s spirit was influencing his thoughts, making him more ruthless and bloodthirsty. Shang-Chi hesitates when Zu orders him to kill Xin, allowing Xin to claim six of the Ten Rings from Shang-Chi and defeat him and his siblings. Shang-Chi fights Xin again at the New House of the Deadly Hand in [[New York City]] but loses the remaining Rings. Zu\'s ghost tells his son that his fear of turning into his father was why Shang-Chi was unable to wield the Ten Rings and urges him to embrace his Zheng lineage to save his family and home. With no other option, Shang-Chi gives in to his dark desires, reclaiming all of the Ten Rings from Xin and unlocking their full potential, giving him a similar appearance and personality to Zu\'s. Under his father\'s influence, Shang-Chi was able to easily defeat Xin and his Qilin Riders, using the Ten Rings to destroy their \'\'taotie\'\' masks. Before a corrupted Shang-Chi could execute Xin, he was talked down by Jiang Li and his siblings. Shang-Chi is brought back to his senses and spares Xin, prompting Zu\'s spirit to denounce him as a coward before disappearing.<ref>\'\'Shang-Chi\'\' (vol. 2) #12.

In this continuity, his likeness and abilities are based on the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]], and he is known as the \'\'\'Master of The Ten Rings\'\'\', a martial arts school that uses mystical powers and techniques based on [[Mandarin\'s rings|the powers of the Mandarin\'s 10 rings]] from the [[Earth-616|mainstream continuity]]. He is also the father of [[Shang-Chi]], who is wanted for the murder of Lord Tuan, the master of the [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] school, the main rival of the Ten Rings school. It is later revealed Zu sent his assassin, [[Elektra (comics)|Red Sai]] of the [[The Hand (comics)|Red Hand]] school, to assassinate Tuan, but she ultimately failed. To spare his lover and her students from the Emperor\'s wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan; Zu had his son implicated and exiled for the murder to cover up his own involvement. Representing the Ten Rings school, Emperor Zu hosts a tournament held every 13 years to decide who the next ruler of K\'un-Lun should be, a position he has won for 100 years. When Shang-Chi returns from his exile to represent his own school, the \'\'\'Lowest Caste\'\'\', Zu allows him to participate, but alters the rules so that Shang-Chi would have to defeat every representative before facing him in the Thirteen Chambers. During their fight, Zu attempts to kill his son with the \'\'\'Spectral Touch\'\'\' technique, only for the move to pass through him, due to Shang-Chi having learned [[Kitty Pryde#Powers and abilities|how to become intangible]]. Shang-Chi proceeds to use nine of the 10 techniques against his father and ultimately defeats him with the \'\'\'[[Gorgon (Tomi Shishido)|Gorgon\'s Eye]]\'\'\', which turns him into stone. With Zu\'s defeat, Shang-Chi becomes the new emperor of K\'un-Lun.<ref>\'\'Master of Kung Fu\'\' (vol. 2) #1-4 (2015)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n=== Role-playing games ===\nFu Manchu appears in the adventures [[Night Moves (adventure)|\'\'Night Moves\'\']] and \'\'Night Live\'\' for the role-playing game \'\'[[Marvel Super Heroes (role-playing game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\'.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fu Manchu|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/fumanchu.htm|url-status=live|access-date=2022-01-03|website=The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\n[[Tony Leung Chiu-wai]] portrays the character of \'\'\'[[Xu Wenwu]]\'\'\' in the live-action [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four]] film \'\'[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]\'\' (2021).<ref>{{Cite magazine|last1=Coggan |first1=Devan |title=Exclusive: Simu Liu suits up in first look at \'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\'|url=https://ew.com/movies/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-simu-liu-first-look/|access-date=2021-04-23|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly|EW.com]]|language=en}}</ref> A [[composite character]] of Fu Manchu and the [[Mandarin (character)|Mandarin]], based on their [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|\'\'Secret Wars\'\' depiction]], the character has been previously referenced in the \'\'Iron Man\'\' trilogy and the short film \'\'[[All Hail the King]]\'\'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-marvel-studios-comic-con-2019-hall-h-panel-liveblog-1836393911|title=The Marvel Studios Comic-Con 2019 Hall H Panel Liveblog!|first=Germain|last=Lussier|website=io9|date=July 20, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n=== Board games ===\nIn the \'\'Secret Wars\'\' Volume 2 for [[Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game]], there is an adaptation of [[Battleworld]] version of Zheng Zu as Emperor of K\'un-Lun and the Ten Rings school, the emperor\'s name is spelled Zheng Zhu.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Wikia|marvel|DeprecatedWikiTitle|Zheng Zu (Earth-616)|Zheng Zu}}\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/fu-manchu/4005-14083/ Fu Manchu] at Comic Vine\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/zheng-zu/4005-172809/ Zheng Zu] at Comic Vine\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/fumanchu.htm|Fu Manchu}}\n* [http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Shangchi.htm The Shang Chi Chronology]\n\n{{Fu Manchu}}\n{{Shang-Chi}}\n{{Jim Starlin}}\n\n[[Category:1973 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\n[[Category:Fictional Chinese people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Shang-Chi characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Starlin]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Englehart]]\n[[Category:Fu Manchu]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]'}]}}}}
