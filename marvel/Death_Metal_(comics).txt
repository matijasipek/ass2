The character appears in the [[Marvel UK]] imprint. He first appeared in \'\'Death³\'\' #1 and was created by [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Dell Barras]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDeath Metal was created by Doctor [[Evelyn Necker]] as part of the Minion project which also produced [[Death\'s Head]] II and [[Death Wreck]]. Necker had sent Death Wreck throughout space and time, and he came back with (among other things) a magical semi-living metal that she called "Promethium" (not to be confused with the real element [[promethium]]). Necker used this metal to create a new cyborg, but she was unaware that the Prometheium had been created by the evil being called Charnel<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/charneld.htm] Death Metal entry at Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe. Last accessed 14 May 2007.</ref> (with whom Dr. Necker had had previous dealings) and Death Metal promptly stole a time machine and fled to the parallel universe of Charnel.\n\nThere he was found by the alternate versions of several mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] [[supervillain]]s, whom he killed, and several alternate versions of several [[superhero]]es, whom he tried to kill. However, Death\'s Head and Death Wreck also arrived in Charnel\'s universe and wound up fighting Death Metal along with the heroes. When that universe\'s [[Ghost Rider]] used his mystical \'\'Penance Stare\'\' on Death Metal, it caused him to see his own sins and realize the extent of Charnel\'s evil. The three cyborg "brothers" then teamed up and defeated Charnel.\n\nDeath Metal was then thrown through a temporal warp to modern-day Earth. After going on a disoriented violent rampage in Toronto, he encountered a being called Argon, a warrior of pure spirit who had been sent from another dimension to end the threat of Death Metal. Death Metal absorbed Argon\'s mind and spirit, only to find that his purity counteracted Death Metal\'s violent rage. Now seeing himself as a monster, he began to seek his own death.\n\n===Alpha Flight===\nWhen the superhero team [[Alpha Flight]] arrived in response to his rampage, he attempted to escalate the fight so that he might be killed. Unfortunately, this only restored his berserker rage, until [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] used her light powers to calm him. Realizing he was still a danger to others, he teleported away (\'\'Death Metal\'\' #2 and \'\'Death Metal vs Genetix\'\' #1).\n\nIn \'\'Death Metal vs. [[Genetix (comics)|Genetix]]\'\', Death Metal sought to create a being that could destroy him. He took cell samples from Alpha Flight\'s [[Madison Jeffries]] and Genetix\'s [[Vesper (comics)|Vesper]] (both of whom could control technology) and created an embryo which he surgically implanted in empath Krista Marwan. Genetix rescued Krista, who inexplicably vowed to have the child.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/deathmet.htm Death Metal at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe]\n* {{Marveldatabase|Death Metal}}\n\n{{Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Death Metal (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Marvel UK titles]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Abnett]]'}]}}}}
