However, Mantis (whose body was now green and had begun to manifest new powers of invulnerability that allowed her to survive in space due to side-effects of her pregnancy) grows bitter with her life and the way she was forced to abandon her child.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} This comes to a head when Mantis is caught in an explosion and presumed dead by Silver Surfer.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She survives, but the strain of the previous years causes her to literally split into multiple versions of herself, each representing conflicting aspects of her psyche that could no longer co-exist inside her mind.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe fragments arrive on Earth and one version of Mantis rejoins the [[West Coast Avengers]] team, with portions of her memories missing.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} (Steve Englehart intended the storyline involving Mantis and her amnesia to be his next major plotline, but editorial problems caused him to quit the series, with the plotline resolved hastily.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}) Mantis discovers, through the temporarily resurrected corpse of the Swordsman, that her psyche had shattered and that she needs to find her counterparts in order to restore her memories.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} She made her way to [[New York City]] where she encountered the [[Fantastic Four]] as they dealt with the effects of the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] storyline.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' 324</ref> Kang pursued Mantis, not realizing she had lost her power and hoping to use her to attack the [[Dreaming Celestial]], and in the process the Surfer was summoned to Earth.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' 323</ref> With the aid of the Cotati, Kang was defeated but Mantis realized she must leave her body and join with the Cotati to raise her son.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #325.

In "The Crossing", Mantis returns as the villainous bride of Kang the Conqueror with the intention of bringing death to the Avengers; her father Libra (who by now was going by the name "[[Moonraker (comics)|Moonraker]]" as part of [[Force Works]]); and the Cotati alien who had possessed the Swordsman\'s body and married/impregnated her. Her anger at her father (whom she had [[Vivisection|vivisected]]) and the Cotati center around their "defilement" of her and that she hates the Avengers for believing their manipulative lies.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe storyline was controversial, so much so that Kurt Busiek, in \'\'[[Avengers Forever]]\'\' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], [[retcon]]ned the Mantis who appeared in the story as being a [[Space Phantom]] brainwashed into thinking he was Mantis.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\n[[File:Mantisavengers131.jpg|thumb|200px| Mantis in action, taking on a larger, stronger foe with characteristic bravado and self-narration.

She returns to Earth and merges with her remaining fragmented portions of her personality (which we learn represent "freak, mother, prostitute, mystic, and Avenger") after the first four are killed by [[Thanos]] (later retroactively declared to be a clone of the real Thanos).{{Issue|date=April 2009}} The final Mantis merges with them to become a "complete" Mantis for the first time since her dispersion. Thus reformed, she and a group of the Avengers go into space to stop "Thanos" from killing her son, Quoi, who by this time is a rebellious teenager desperate to leave the isolation of the Cotati home-world and travel the stars. During the adventure, Mantis flirts with Vision (with the implication that she has sex with him), but ultimately ends the flirting when she realizes that he has feelings for his estranged wife Scarlet Witch, who is jealous of Mantis and Vision\'s friendship. Mantis also appears in the "[[Avengers Disassembled]]" storyline, although many occurrences in that storyline are illusions.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nMantis appears in the 2007 miniseries \'\'[[Annihilation: Conquest]]: Star-Lord\'\', where she is shown as a Kree prisoner who volunteers for a mission led by Peter Quill, a.k.a. [[Star-Lord]].<ref>\'\'[[Annihilation: Conquest]] â€“ Starlord\'\' #1.

Overhearing Mantis and Star-Lord converse about their deception, [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] shared this knowledge with the rest of the team. This caused most of the members to leave. Mantis was promoted to field status by [[Rocket Raccoon]].<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2 #4-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMantis was apparently killed by the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], who, upon anticipating that Mantis would use her mental powers to incapacitate him, struck her and her fellow psionic Cosmo dead with a powerful blast of energy.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 2 #19 (Dec. 2009). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, it was revealed that she, along with fellow Guardians [[Phyla-Vell]], Cosmo, [[Gamora]] and [[Vance Astro|Major Victory]] are still alive, but being held prisoner in suspended animation by the Magus.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #22</ref> She reunites with the other team of Guardians, telling Moondragon that Phyla-Vell was the first one killed by Thanos\' rampage.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nMantis later rescues [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] from a group of pursuing Spartax soldiers. Though she refuses to join his new incarnation of the Guardians, she helps him track down the source of mysterious "time quakes" that have been plaguing him in the wake of the \'\'[[Age of Ultron]]\'\' storyline.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol. 3 #5 (July 2013).

She also had psychic empathy, a [[telepathy|telepathic]] power that allowed her to sense the emotions of others.\n\nMantis gained additional abilities as a result of communion with the Prime Cotati. Her empathic ability enabled her to communicate with the plant-like [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] and with plant life. To travel in space, Mantis had the ability to separate her physical and [[astral projection|astral]] forms, projecting her consciousness from her body, allowing her to travel interplanetary distances. She also had the ability to transfer her astral form to any place where plant life exists. She could form and inhabit a plant like simulacrum of her human body for herself out of the destination planet\'s local vegetation. Her fighting skills remained intact, and her empathic abilities were heightened to a superhuman degree and extended to the planet\'s flora and biosphere. She could control the vegetation within her vicinity.\n\nDuring her confrontations with a powerful Thanos clone, she displayed superhuman strength, a talent to simultaneously inhabit multiple simulacra, and the ability to project strong blasts of energy, but has not been seen using these powers since.<ref>\'\'Avengers: Celestial Quest\'\' #1-8 (2001). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAs of her appearance in \'\'Annihilation Conquest: Star-Lord\'\', Mantis also appears to have gained telepathic and precognitive abilities, and apparently now labors under a constant awareness of future events.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} The source of these new powers is as yet unclear. Other powers displayed or referred to during the series were [[pyrokinesis]], mid-range [[mentat]] training, and invisibility to the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].\n\n===Personality===\nIn her first appearances, Mantis represents the "[[Dragon Lady]]" archetype, that of a mysterious Eastern seductress whose sexuality causes tension among the male Avengers.<ref name="Austin">{{cite book| last1 = Austin| first1 = Allan W.| last2=Hamilton | first2= Patrick L. | title = All New, All Different?: A History of Race and the American Superhero| publisher = University of Texas Press | year = 2019| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DdarDwAAQBAJ| isbn = 978-1-4773-1897-3}}</ref> She is assertive and confident in her powers, and while she appeared somewhat arrogant at first (as illustrated by her breakup with Swordsman when she chose Vision over him),<ref name="Writeups">[https://www.writeups.org/mantis-avengers-marvel-comics/ Mantis at Writeups.org]</ref> she renounced her pride after Swordsman\'s tragic death.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #130.

She and the believers succeed in reviving Warlock who is revealed to be in an infant state. She and the believers all kneel and as they do the guardians swoop in and steal kid Warlock away, foiling the believers plans. Later it is revealed that J\'son himself was the leader of the Believers and that after her imprisonment, Mantis\' mental powers along with that of all believers were removed and used to create "belif-batteries". These batteries were used by the cult to create various energy weapons. After failing with Warlock, Mantis tries to recruit [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Sam Alexander]] in order to free J\'son from prison. Despite the interference of the Guardians her plan succeeds and she along with J\'son and Sam escape. The trio search for Nova centurion helmets that J\'son seeks to use to create a new empire.

J\'son then orders Mantis and Sam to find suitable helmets for him to use.
