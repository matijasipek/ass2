As his congregation (which consisted primarily of downtrodden minorities) grew, the Rev prepared to move out of the "fascist, racist United States" and into [[Suriname|Dutch Guiana]].<ref name = "Four">{{Cite comic|writer = Mike Baron|penciller = Klaus Janson|inker = Klaus Janson|colorist = Klaus Janson|letterer = Ken Bruzenak|editor = Carl Potts|story = The Rev|title = The Punisher|volume = 2|issue = #4|date = November 1987|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nWhen an arms dealer refuses to sell to him, the Rev has the man killed, which prompts the [[Punisher]] to infiltrate the Church of the Saved. The Punisher\'s first mission as a member of the cult sees the Rev ordering him and two others to obtain a videotape in the possession of an unstable reporter, who intends to create a documentary about the Church of the Saved. The Punisher (who acquires the tape, and keeps it for himself) is fatally shot by the deranged journalist, but is healed by the Rev. Afterward, the Punisher watches the tape, which shows the Rev murdering a man who had tried to leave the Church.<ref name = "Four"/>\n\nThe Rev has everyone board a ship to "[[Jonestown|Smithtown]]" in Dutch Guiana, where he has the Punisher train the congregation in preparation for what the Rev claims will be an imminent attack by the United States.

The Punisher shoots the Rev in the stomach, forces his sister to flee, and announces to the Church of the Saved that the Rev gave his life for them, and that it was his dying wish that they "work for change" back in the United States.<ref name = "Five"/>\n\n=== Venezuela ===\n\nThe Rev survived and, concluding that evil is more powerful than good, comes to [[Theistic Satanism|worship]] [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]], who he believes to be [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)#Lucifer (Prince of Darkness)|Lucifer]], and the source of his powers. Establishing a base in a [[Tepui]] temple, the Rev enslaves a village, and forces the tribesmen to cultivate a rare plant that can be used to create a sterility-inducing drug.
