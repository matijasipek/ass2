The eight, all personal friends of Wonder Man, manage to summon Wonder Man\'s help and the villains are defeated. During the fight Rampage hesitates to kill several Eight members; wondering instead if he might be able to use them to create better technology.<ref>\'\'Wonder Man\'\' #20-21 (April–May 1993).
