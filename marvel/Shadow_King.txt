All that is known is that he was living in Morocco until the 1800s before taking Farouk as a host. He claims to be a [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiversal]] manifestation of the dark side of the human consciousnesses, spawned by the first nightmare, and has since been feeding on the shadows in their souls, transferring from host to host since the dawn of humanity.<ref>\'\'All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\'\' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFor many years, the Shadow King\'s primary human manifestation was Amahl Farouk. When Amahl Farouk\'s powers developed he could psychically control those around him, and merged with the Shadow King. As Farouk, the Shadow King originally confronted [[Professor Xavier|Professor X]] (inspiring him to form the [[X-Men]]).\n\n===As Amahl Farouk in the 1930s===\nThe Shadow King was known as Amahl Farouk in 1931, working for two of [[Adolf Hitler]]\'s special agents ([[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]] and [[Geist (Marvel Comics)|Geist]]). Von Strucker and Geist planned to dethrone [[King Edward VIII|King Edward]] of England and replace him with a [[Fascism|fascist]] ruler sympathetic to Hitler. When Farouk conducted a mystical ceremony, he accidentally brought back [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] host [[Rachel Summers]] and her teammate [[Shadowcat]] (also known as Kitty Pryde). Von Strucker began to doubt Farouk\'s abilities. The Shadow King quickly possessed Rachel Summers and, as Shadowcat escaped, allied herself with Alasdhair Kinross. Farouk kidnapped the heir to the throne, [[Queen Elizabeth II|Lilibet]], and fled to Edinburgh. When Shadowcat tried to reach Summers telepathically, she found Farouk in control. Pryde surprised Farouk by calling him "Shadow King", enabling her to escape. Farouk took control of Kinross and tried to kill them both, but Pryde used her phasing powers to disrupt Kinross\'s nervous system and knock him out.  \n \nAlthough Farouk was going to sacrifice Kinross to demons in return for a spell which would annihilate the English monarchy, he was interrupted by Kitty and his crystal knife shattered. The demons entered Farouk\'s body, overpowering him. He began dispersing energy, killing all the Nazi soldiers; von Strucker accused him of treason and tried to shoot him. Farouk transformed into the Shadow King and tried to force Pryde and Kinross to fight, but they were saved by a young [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]]. Phoenix unleashed her power on Farouk, but she was subdued and possessed. Lilibet escaped, fleeing to [[Holyrood House]]. Farouk possessed the house\'s servants and sent them and Phoenix in pursuit. Logan ambushed Farouk, von Strucker and Geist, but Farouk had Summers and the servants attack him. Farouk then possessed Pryde and Lilibet. \n \nPryde began talking about the future and the fall of Hitler; Lilibet attacked Farouk, disabling him enough for Pryde to disrupt his nervous system (stunning them both and giving Summers time to regain control of herself). Farouk recovered and tried to retake his prisoners, but Phoenix fought on the astral plane. Phoenix was going to kill him when Pryde struck them with the Sword of Scones, causing them to return to their bodies; Farouk\'s body was supposedly destroyed by an energy blast from the sword but later when questioned by Rachel if they had killed Farouk, Pryde reveals that they had for the moment only weakened him.<ref>\'\'X-Men: True Friends\'\' #01-03. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Confrontation with Charles Xavier===\nIn 1971, Farouk returned and met [[V-Battalion]] leader [[Citizen V#J.J. Watkins|James Watkins Jr.]] Watkins offered him V-Battalion support if Farouk could obtain information about the Everlasting. Farouk gave Watkins the name of Marduk.<ref>\'\'Citizen V and the V-Battalion Everlasting\'\' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFarouk became a crime lord in [[Egypt]], controlling [[Cairo]]\'s Thieves Quarter (where a young [[Professor X|Charles Xavier\'s]] [[Pickpocketing|pocket was picked]] by a child, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]]). After Xavier stopped her and retrieved his wallet, he was struck by a bolt of [[Psionics|psionic]] energy. When he recovered, he discovered that the source of the attack was a nearby tavern (where he met Farouk). Sitting at separate tables, they conversed telepathically. Farouk told Xavier that he sensed another telepath nearby, and the attack was a warning to stay clear of the area. \n \nHe unsuccessfully tried to persuade Xavier to join him in his criminal activities; Xavier believed that people with such gifts should use them to better the world. They assumed astral form, and Xavier defeated Farouk on the astral plane with a fatal psionic attack. Farouk was Xavier\'s first encounter with an evil mutant, which led to the formation of the X-Men. His psyche still on the Astral plane, Farouk awaited another chance to fight Xavier (whom he now feared).<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 01 #117.

In one of the team\'s earliest missions, Karma was apparently killed in an explosion at the [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper\'s]] hideout. However, the Shadow King used Karma\'s powers against her to possess her.\n\nAs Karma, the Shadow King rebuilt his worldwide empire while indulging his gluttony through her body. He used her to control the Gladiators, a group of mutants, by using a holographic image of leader Alexander Flynn.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' vol. 01 #30. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Shadow King used the Gladiators to abduct [[Magma (comics)|Magma]] and [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], forcing them to fight each other until teammates [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Shadowcat]], [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]], and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] tried to rescue them. In their battle to escape the Gladiators, Cannonball and Shadowcat recognized their obese antagonist as Karma (not realizing that she was controlled by the Shadow King).<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' vol. 01 #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe team followed Karma to [[Madripoor]], where they were subjected to Karma\'s [[mind control]] (augmented by the Shadow King). The remaining New Mutants and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] fought their teammates in Cairo, where Karma took control of Storm and [[Moonstar (comics)|Mirage]]. Magik, realizing that Karma was possessed by the Shadow King, released her teammates from Karma\'s control and Karma from the Shadow King.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' vol. 01 #32.

[[Forge (comics)|Forge]] used meditation to enter the astral plane, discovering that [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] was still alive but at the cost of his [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] arm. When the Shadow King tried to claim the child, he was questioned about his motives, at which point he killed a man and framed Storm. On [[Muir Island]], the telepath [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] used [[Cerebro]] to look for Storm and the other X-Men when the Shadow King attacked and possessed him; he also controlled [[Moira MacTaggert]] and Valerie Cooper, after which he sent [[Valerie Cooper]] to kill [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. \n \nThe Shadow King set a trap to capture Storm. Her youth gave her less control of her mutant powers, and when he tried to possess her mind she involuntarily hit him with a lightning bolt, but he soon found her with [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]]. They worked together to fight him, escaping with the Shadow King\'s hounds in pursuit. Mystique defeated Valerie Cooper and impersonated her, appearing on television to report Mystique\'s death. Part of [[Carol Danvers]] separated from [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and traveled to [[Muir Island]], where she was forced to fight Legion and Moira MacTaggert, when she emerged from the Siege Perilous in the X-Men\'s former Australian hideout. Although she defeated them, she was possessed by the Shadow King. He compelled her to go to the [[Savage Land]] to find Rogue, but she was defeated on arrival by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #269. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Shadow King, with his ambitious schemes, was afraid of being identified by other telepaths. He needed a nexus between the astral and psionic planes to generate a disturbance which would affect other telepaths. [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]\' powers had been recently altered by [[Zaladane]], and he chose Polaris as his nexus.\n\n[[Jean Grey]] tried to access the astral plane with Cerebro, but the Shadow King overrode Cerebro\'s defenses and noticed that Jean had lost her telepathic powers and was helpless. He tried to turn her into his Shadow Queen, but [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]] unaware of who he was, threatened him with her psi-blade but ended using it on Jean instead, returning her to the physical world; however, they could not remember the details of the encounter and his identity was not yet compromised.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #273. Marvel Comics.</ref> His control over Muir Island was only uncovered when Professor X probed Colossus\' mind after the latter tried to kill him.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #279. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe X-Men sent a task force which included [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Gambit]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] to remove his influence. The Shadow King sent his slaves to defend the island, and they defeated the invaders. Xavier understood that he needed a human host and a nexus to continue his exploits, and planned to cut both the links. [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] revealed herself and shot Jacob Reisz in the head, destroying his brain and killing the Shadow King\'s human host. Due to shock and the removal of the Shadow King\'s host, [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] became unstable. [[X-Factor (comics)#X-Factor|X-Factor]] discovered that his nexus was Polaris, but the Shadow King took possession of Legion. He ordered the slaves to hide underground because he was going to use Legion\'s power to destroy the surface of Muir Island. Jean Grey\'s telekinesis protected X-Factor and the X-Men.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #280. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nXavier then used Jean as a psi-anchor to fight the Shadow King in the astral plane, but he was defeated; reveling in making Xavier suffer, he issued psychic attacks so intense that they manifested as physical damage, breaking Xavier\'s legs and crippling him in the process. [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] joined [[Jean Grey|Jean]] in the astral plane to help Xavier, unaware of Legion\'s body nearby. Although they gave Xavier willpower and energy, the possessed Legion destroyed a large swath of Muir island; upon awakening, Xavier acknowledges that his physical damage has returned him to a paraplegic state. Forge uses Psylocke\'s psi-blade on Polaris, breaking the Shadow King\'s link to the nexus, after which his energy dissipated overcoming the X-Men. Xavier and Jean tried to absorb whatever they could and shield the others. Xavier offered the Shadow King a chance to redeem himself, but he opted for the void and Legion was left in a coma.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #253-280. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Psi-War===\nAfter the Onslaught incident in which Charles Xavier lost his powers, the Shadow King could return to the physical world since the psionic plane had lost its guardian. Posing as "Ananasi", the Shadow King took over the [[Africa]]n tribe who worshiped Storm. After attacking one of her relatives, Psylocke took Storm to the astral plane to fight "Ananasi" only to find the villagers’ minds set up in a distinct pattern. Before they can discern the reasoning, "Ananasi" attacks Psylocke and brings up her past failures and how she was always considered a redundant Jean Grey-wannabe. Ainet finds Storm and tells her the truth, but "Ananasi" buries Storm under bones of her dead friends before she can tell Betsy the truth. Psylocke falls into "Ananasi"’s trap and accidentally hits one of the villagers with her psi-blade. This caused a chain reaction that cripples the entire psionic plan itself, damaging the collective subconscious of every being on Earth (the basis of the psi-plane) as well as all psi-sensitive in the corporeal world. Humans experienced \'\'déjà vu\'\', nightmares, migraines or nosebleeds, and those born with psionic, telepathic or intuitive abilities were maimed; [[Jean Grey|Jean]] and [[Nate Grey]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Emma Frost]], [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and Bianca LaNiege were devastated. [[Madelyne Pryor|"Maddie"]] Pryor (Nate Grey\'s psionic construct from Madelyne Pryor\'s psionic remnants) was obliterated, and [[Doctor Strange|Dr. Strange]] and [[Spider-Man]] were also affected while Psylocke is left as a discombobulated mess, as "Ananasi" reveals himself to be the Shadow King, now free of any opposition on the Psionic Plane.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol.02 #77. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the world\'s telepaths crippled, the Shadow King ascends to dominance and, one by one, begins to corrupt mankind. He explains to Psylocke that although he was defeated and thought dead by Charles Xavier at Muir Island, as long as one dark thought exists in [[Human|man]], he can live. He went into hibernation, for the lack of a better word. He eventually bids her farewell forever as he teleports away and Psylocke turns to stone and then falls apart. Yet the [[Crimson Dawn]] saves Psylocke once again and resurrects her, this time with an all black psi-form and the ability to command the shadows of the Psionic Plane, which allow her to go undetected by the Shadow King. She eventually confronts the Shadow King and pretends to be tempted by his offer to become the Shadow Queen to distract him while Storm freed the other X-Men. However Farouk saw through the ruse; Psylocke sent the X-Men to the physical world and takes the fight directly to the Shadow King, who stretches his powers to the maximum to infect every mind on Earth. Psylocke is intoxicated by the power, but keeps her focus and discovers that the Shadow King has left his nexus, the soul of every person on the Psionic Plane, exposed as his body unravels to reach every mind. Psylocke uses her shadows to contain the nexus and the Shadow King is trapped, but only as long as Psylocke focuses her telepathy on him, which means she can never use her powers again or else he will be set free. Psylocke leaves the Psionic Plane for the last time and reveals what happened to Storm.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol.02 #78. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSometime later the Shadow King reached Psylocke\'s mind when she\'s forced to use Cerebro to cleansed Logan of the Death persona with a little push from each of Logan\'s closest friends, but Archangel experienced a metamorphosis of his own from his close contact to Apocalypse\'s handiwork.<ref>\'\'Wolverine (2nd series)\'\' #146.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Freedom===\nThe Shadow King was eventually released from his prison when Psylocke perished in combat with the mutant hunter, Vargas. Once again free, he possessed the Reavers and attempted to attack the X-Men. However, Rogue used her acquired memories as well as Sage\'s computer like mind and attacked the Shadow King, binding his core as Psylocke had done.<ref>\'\'[[X-Treme X-Men]] [[Annual publication|Annual]] 2001\'\'. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===New Excalibur===\nDue to the events of House of M, the Shadow King was released from his prison and was able to escape to an alternate reality, Earth-6141.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files\'\'. Marvel Comics.</ref> Once there, he possessed their version of Professor X and then corrupted the original X-Men (whom he called the [[Shadow-X|Dark X-Men]]). He maintained constant telepathic contact and control over them and forced them to kill all the heroes of their world. The Scarlet Witch\'s Decimation Wave enabled the Shadow King to bring himself and his team to [[Earth-616]] in order to gain revenge on those who had crossed him. He tried to kill [[Captain Britain]] with the controlled [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005–2007)|New Excalibur]], but was again defeated by Psylocke (who was revived by her brother, [[Jamie Braddock]]).<ref>\'\'New Excalibur\'\' #08. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Dark X-Men tried to free Xavier from his prison with the help of [[Lionheart (comics)|Lionheart]]. Lionheart sealed the Shadow King in the Dark Xavier\'s body, releasing the Shadow-X from his control and killed Dark Xavier therefore sending the Shadow King back to the Astral plane.<ref>\'\'New Excalibur #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===X-Men: Worlds Apart===\nThe Shadow King reappeared in [[Wakanda]], where he killed a Wakandan priest and framed former New X-Men member [[Gentle (comics)|Gentle]]. He then controlled [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to confront his longtime enemy (and T\'Challa\'s wife), Storm. The Shadow King intended to break Storm psychologically, forcing her to choose between the X-Men and her husband. He forced [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] to attack [[Emma Frost]] and the rest of the X-Men in California and forced the Black Panther to wreak havoc in Africa. While Storm raced to save the Black Panther and the X-Men, she recognized a third option: to take down the one responsible for making her choose. Storm defeated the Black Panther and flew with Gentle to San Francisco, taking down Gentle and the rest of the active X-Men (controlled by the Shadow King). She struck Cyclops (the Shadow King\'s host) with a bolt of lightning, stopping his heart and forcing the Shadow King to possess Storm. This was a trap; when he entered Storm\'s mind, the Shadow King found the panther god [[Bast (Marvel Comics)|Bast]] waiting for him. Storm revealed that she allowed the Wakanda panther god to hide in her mind to avenge the Shadow King for violating T\'Challa\'s mind. Bast essentially and literally devoured the Shadow King\'s astral form. Farouk\'s plan to cut Storm off from her relationships instead strengthened them.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Worlds Apart\'\' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===\nThe Shadow King\'s nexus survived however and when he recuperated he took over a military base\'s nuclear facility to use its missiles, aiming them at [[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]] and New York. The X-Force headed to the military base after losing contact with Deadpool (who was investigating the psychic emanations felt by Betsy), learning that the Shadow King controlled the base.\n\nHe told Psylocke that her mind is an open book to him, and releases Archangel from his psychic prison in Warren\'s memory in revenge; Archangel cuts off the Shadow King\'s "head", erasing Betsy\'s memory and enabling her to kill the man who was under the Shadow King\'s influence.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Shadow King gave a reporter photographs of Warren killing the military, forcing the squad to apprehend their teammate and seek help from [[Dark Beast]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Farouk, the Shadow King appeared as a member of [[Daken]]\'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] (consisting of [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], Skinless Man, the [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] from [[Age of Apocalypse|Earth-295]], and the [[Omega Red|Omega Clan]]) in a plot to attack the [[X-Force]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe created an illusion of the Professor and Angel to catch Psylocke off-guard, expressing disappointment at the ease of defeating the warrior who caged him. Farouk was with the Brotherhood as they watched the apparent death of the X-Force. He, Creed and Daken showed Evan that his life was a computer-generated illusion and he was a clone of Apocalypse. The Brotherhood unsuccessfully planned to compel Evan to put on Apocalypse armor, make the Shadow King control him and destroy Jean Grey\'s school.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> Psylocke locked the Shadow King in Omega White\'s body and entrusted it to her brother, Captain Britain.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nApparently Brian or someone at his command had sealed the Shadow King\'s host body in a tomb in the [[Gobi Desert]] where it was eventually found in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] erroneously trapped inside Omega Black\'s body by the Crimson Pirates and unwittingly released by their telepath, Bloody Bess. He possessed the Pirates except for Bess, who appealed to [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] for help. Nightcrawler and Bess fought the Pirates and the X-Men, who were controlled by the Shadow King. He was defeated when Bess and Psylocke threw off his mind control and sent Nightcrawler against him armed with Psylocke\'s psi-blade, which stunned him long enough to be interred again in Omega Black\'s body.<ref>\'\'Nightcrawler\'\' (2014) #8-#10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Psi-War II===\nThe Shadow King has since been revealed to be imprisoned in the Astral Plane, but still trying to force his way out to the physical world. He began targeting psychics to build a web in order to escape the Astral Plane and the first one was Psylocke, who fell prey to him and would have released him if not for the intervention of Rogue, Old Man Logan, Warren, Bishop, Gambit and Fantomex. Knowing now that others psychics can fall prey too, Psylocke sends to the Astral Plane her teammates in order to defeat the Shadow King, unaware that he had changed, now half-human half-spider and is waiting for them. He also reveals that he has imprisoned in his realm the astral form of Professor Xavier.<ref>\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' (Vol. 4) #01. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAs they arrive, they quickly fall into the Shadow King\'s illusions and if they don\'t break it their bodies and souls will fall under his control. Old Man Logan suddenly remembers everything and helps the other X-Men realize that the Shadow King is affecting their memories. As the room they are in transforms, they see three doors in front of them. Logan mentions that while the Shadow King is controlling things there are two minds involved in whatever they are in, which is how he figured out the play was fake.<ref>\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' (Vol. 4) #02. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the battle\'s final moments, Shadow King spread a psychic infection on London before the X-Men ultimately defeated him with Fantomex donating his body to Professor X\'s astral form while his mind remained in the Astral Plane.<ref>\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' (Vol. 4) #06. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' (Vol. 4) #07. Marvel Comics.</ref> Professor Xavier now using the alias of X, controlled the psychic infection which was soon afterwards revealed to be actually Proteus which X unwittingly reconstituted back. X then convinced Psylocke to form a psychic network and draw its power to push back Proteus\' influence, however the Shadow King had planted a portion of himself in Xavier\'s mind and took advantage of this strategy and accessed the network to escape from the Astral Plane through X\'s body.<ref>\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' (Vol. 4) #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Shadow King defeated the X-Men, X managed to recover and worked together with Psylocke to create a deeper psychic network to defeated him once and for all. X erased the memories of all of the X-Men involved in his return save for Psylocke so she could watch over him in case the Shadow King wasn\'t truly gone from his mind.<ref>\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' (Vol. 4) #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Dawn of X===\nDuring the "[[Empyre]]" storyline, Amahl Farouk is among the psychic mutants that are summoned to Genosha to help deal with a seed pod-type bomb that is vulnerable to psychic attacks,<ref>\'\'Empyre: X-Men\'\' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> and it\'s revealed that Amahl and the Shadow King are actually two different individuals. Having been born in Egypt Eyalet, to a merchant trader, during the sixteenth century, Amahl Farouk is a mutant whose psychic powers emerged at a young age. Amahl then used them to protect the market from thieves, until tragedy would eventually arrive to the market in the form of a plague. The young Amahl sat with his dying father and tried to use his telepathic powers to prevent the inevitable, suggesting that his telepathic powers likely allowed him to "feel" his father\'s death as partly his own. With his father dead and the market gone, the young mutant had nothing to tether him to the city until he was approached by the Shadow King, who promised the boy a chance to never be alone again. From that moment on, Amahl was immersed in darkness as he joined with the Shadow King. Also while Amahl Farouk himself has already been seen on Krakoa, it wasn\'t clear if the Shadow King was still a part of the mutant\'s life, until a group of young mutants finishes their training and head for the caves on Krakoa, far from their instructors. There, Amahl Farouk, clearly still possessed by the Shadow King, awaits them to listening intently to the young X-Men and doubtlessly planning something sinister for the youngest mutants.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' (2019) #14</ref>\n\nIn time, the Shadow King sets his plans in motion and begins seducing several young mutants who are unsure of themselves, including [[X-23#Gabby Kinney|Gabrielle Kinney]] and [[Wolfsbane (character)|Rahne Sinclair]].<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' (2019) #16</ref> However, Gabrielle begins to suspect Farouk and is subsequently killed by Rahne, whom he had placed under his mind control.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' (2019) #18-20</ref> Gabrielle is resurrected, and confronted by the senior New Mutants, Farouk draws them and Gabrielle\'s clique into the astral plane.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' (2019) #20-21</ref> The young mutants confront the Shadow King, encouraging Farouk to dissolve his connection with him, restoring his human mind and personality. Scarred by his connection with the Shadow King, Farouk leaves Krakoa, with the endorsement of the New Mutants, to undergo rehabilitation.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' (2019) #23-24</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Powers and abilities}}Powers and abilities==\n===The Shadow King===\nOriginally presented as a telepathic mutant second only to Professor X, the Shadow King is truly a multi-universal ethereal entity extending into each reality as a tendril of its larger self, spawned by the first nightmare and preying on the bodies of powerful psychics and using them to enslave others all the while feeding off their negative energy and causes them to slowly merge with his own essence.<ref>\'\'All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z\'\' #9</ref> \nIn its native form, the Shadow King is able to possess other beings and although he can be harmed psychically or by magic weapons, he is incapable of truly being killed or expelled permanently.\n\nHe can influence many individuals telepathically but typically chooses only one host to occupy with his disembodied spirit.

He assumes the guise of crime lord Amahl Farouk and encounters Charles Xavier; they wage a psychic battle on the astral plane which kills Farouk\'s body, forcing his mind to move there. When Xavier died, the Shadow King became an agent of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and appeared as a cloudy face in a bottle in his sanctum.<ref name="Alpha">\'\'X-Men\'\' Alpha.

Soon, Farouk took direct action, dragging Ororo into the astral plane after a tiring battle and confronting her about her past. Once he revealed the circumstances of his transformation into the Shadow King, he attacked the X-Men with his Brood army; however, Storm\'s willingness to let go of the past allowed her to once again attack Farouk, but intentionally, and his form disappeared from the plane, implying that he had died in the physical realm. His attack on the X-Men with the Brood was also revealed to be a ruse on Farouk\'s part.<ref name="Ultimate X-Men #89"/>\n\n===\'\'X-Men \'92\'\'===\nIn Marvel\'s 2015 \'\'[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\'\' storyline, the [[X-Men: The Animated Series|1992 \'\'X-Men\'\' animated series]] was adapted into a limited series where this reality was made into the [[Battleworld]] domain of Westchester.

Prior to the revelation of the character\'s identity, he was referred to by [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]] as "the Devil with the Yellow Eyes" (portrayed by Quinton Boisclair). The Shadow King takes several forms over the course of the series other than his real form, including the aforementioned "Devil" form of an obese man with thin, long limbs, Haller\'s childhood dog King, the "Angry Boy" (portrayed by [[Devyn Dalton]]) who is a manifestation of the title character from the children\'s book \'\'The World\'s Angriest Boy in the World\'\', Haller\'s friend in the Clockworks Institute - Busker, and a friend from his youth named Benny (portrayed by [[Kirby Morrow]]). Originally a mutant enemy of [[Professor X|David\'s father]], the Shadow King\'s consciousness escaped his death and latched on to David as a kind of psychic parasite, using David\'s mutant abilities to grow stronger. His presence influenced David\'s mental instability and the way he perceives reality. In the second season, Farouk assumes his true appearance during his quest to find his original body,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2018/01/05/legion-season-2-cast-navid-negahban-ahmal-farouk-shadow-king/ |title=Legion Adds Homeland Alum Navid Negahban in Season 2 Villain Recast |publisher=TVLine |first=Dave |last=Nemetz |date=January 5, 2018 |access-date=January 5, 2018}}</ref> which resembles that of his comics counterpart, being of Middle-Eastern appearance, sporting three-piece suits and the signature circular sunglasses, though lacks the fez (instead having a semi-balding head of hair) and isn\'t morbidly obese (unlike his appearance as "the Devil with Yellow Eyes"). In season 3, however, his younger self wears the fez.\n\n====Animation====\n*Shadow King appears in two episodes of \'\'[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]\'\' (1992–97), voiced by [[Maurice Dean Wint]]. In flashbacks he is the first evil mutant faced by a younger Charles Xavier, who banished his spirit to the astral plane. Farouk is depicted as an athletic, middle-aged bearded man instead of his bald, obese appearance in the comics.\n*Shadow King appears in the \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\' episode, "Overflow", voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. In a flashback, Farouk takes in Ororo to steal for him until Professor X defeats him, the battle destroying his body. In the present, he finds his way to and possesses Storm, forcing her to see Africa burning; she tries to extinguish the fire, unaware that her efforts are the real cause of the destruction. The X-Men confront the Shadow King, allowing anyone he could use as a host to get away, weakening him enough for [[Emma Frost]], fighting him on the astral plane, to apparently destroy him with a telepathic sword.\n\n===Video games===\n*Shadow King is one of three primary villains in the video game \'\'[[X-Men Legends]]\'\', voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]].
