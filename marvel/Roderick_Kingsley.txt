Originally created by [[Roger Stern]] and [[Mike Zeck]] for \'\'[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Volume One (1976â1998)|Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\' #43 (June 1980), the character was later brought back in the [[1997 in comics|1997]] storyline \'\'[[Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives]]\'\', in which he was revealed as the first and most prominent incarnation of the [[supervillain]] \'\'\'[[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]]\'\'\', created by Stern and [[John Romita Jr.]] in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #238 (March 1983), and previously revealed to be the [[Assassination|assassinated]] [[Ned Leeds]] in [[1987 in comics|1987]], the latter being [[Retroactive continuity|retroactively revealed]] to have been a [[Brainwashing|brainwashed]] [[patsy]] manipulated by Kingsley over the course of the \'\'Hobgoblin Lives\'\' storyline.\n\nA conniving fashion designer in [[New York City]], Kingsley gained access to one of [[Norman Osborn]]\'s lairs that housed the [[Green Goblin]]\'s equipment. Kingsley upgraded the inventions and perfected the Goblin formula, which enhanced his physical abilities and intellect without insanity. Adopting a [[Halloween]]-themed appearance and an arsenal of weapons similar to that of his predecessor, including explosive "Pumpkin Bombs", razor-sharp bats, and a high-tech "Goblin Glider", Kingsley became the criminal mastermind known as the Hobgoblin. He has endured as one of the superhero [[Spider-Man]]\'s most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up web-slinger\'s [[List of Spider-Man enemies|rogues gallery]].\n\nIn 2009, the Hobgoblin was ranked by [[IGN]] as the 57th-greatest comic book villain of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/57.html |title= Hobgoblin is number 57 - IGN |publisher= Comics.ign.com |access-date= 2010-08-13 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100809124321/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/57.html |archive-date= 2010-08-09 }}</ref> The character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as [[television series]] and [[video game]]s.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Roderick Kingsley\'s debut.png|thumb|upright|left|Roderick Kingsley made his debut in \'\'[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\' #43 (June 1980).

In order to throw readers off the scent and provide a [[retroactive continuity|retroactive explanation]] for his inconsistent characterization of Kingsley in his early appearances, Stern came up with the idea of Kingsley having his brother Daniel Kingsley sometimes impersonate him, sealing the deception by having the Hobgoblin appear in the same room as Kingsley in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #249.<ref name="Back35"/>\n\nStern\'s original plan was to have the mystery of the Hobgoblin\'s identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the Green Goblin\'s identity, meaning the truth would be revealed in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #264.<ref name="Back35"/> However, Stern left the series after \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #252, and [[Tom DeFalco]] his successors felt Kingsley was a weak choice for the Hobgoblin\'s true identity.<ref name="Back35"/> Thus, the Hobgoblin was ultimately unmasked as [[Ned Leeds]] in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #289 (after considerable creative struggle over the issue), and [[Jason Macendale]] took over as the Hobgoblin.<ref name="SpideyKicksButt">{{cite web |url=https://www.spidermancrawlspace.com/2020/05/squandered-legacy-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-hobgoblin-part-two-the-goblin-in-decline/ |title=Squandered Legacy: The Rise and Fall of the HobGoblin Part Two: The Goblin in Decline |author= Fettinger, J.R. |access-date=2009-02-19 |work= Spidey Kicks Butt }}</ref>\n\nStern was unhappy with the revelation that the Hobgoblin\'s civilian identity was Leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries \'\'Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives\'\' in 1997, with the [[retcon]] that Kingsley was the original Hobgoblin and had brainwashed Leeds as a [[fall guy]]. Stern followed up the miniseries with the \'\'Spider-Man\'\' storyline "Goblins at the Gate", which resulted in Kingsley and [[Norman Osborn]] being bitter rivals obsessed with each other\'s destruction over the [[Goblin (Marvel Comics)|Goblin]] legacy, although Leeds would later be retconned further by a different writer to have also been a willing Hobgoblin.{{clear left}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nRoderick Kingsley started out as a socialite, [[fashion design]]er and billionaire who had criminal underworld connections and had come about his wealth through unethical business practices and corporate raiding.

He accompanies the Sinister Six in a plot to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man\'\' #234. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers, abilities, and weaknesses==\nRoderick Kingsley initially had no superhuman abilities, but possessed a keen analytical intellect with enough knowledge of chemistry and biology to understand Mendel Stromm\'s notes regarding the Goblin formula. Kingsley not only recreated the formula but perfected by removing side-effects. Further, he updated many of Osborn\'s various Goblin inventions. With a technological means developed by [[List of Spider-Man enemies#Brainwasher|Brainwasher]], Kingsley can control the human mind through hypnosis and programming, typically to create stand-ins for himself. Kingsley was skilled in the management of both criminal organizations and legally run professional businesses. Due to his green chemical solution exposure, Kingsley possesses superhuman strength on par with Spider-Man<ref name="Hobbylives1"/> and stronger than Osborn (due to its improvements and duration of Kingsley\'s exposure was longer). Likewise, his reflexes, speed, stamina, and intellect were also enhanced to superhuman levels. As the Hobgoblin, he wore bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic, cape, and cowl. A computerized system cybernetically causes the finger-blasters to randomly vary their attack vectors when trained on a particular target. He uses a [[Goblin glider]], a one-man miniature turbo-fan-powered vertical thrust, cybernetically-controlled vehicle. It can reach high velocities and is extremely maneuverable. He uses concussion and incendiary Jack O\'Lanterns, wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, bat shaped razor-edged throwing blades, and gloves woven with micro-circuited power conducting filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity. He wore a shoulder bag to carry his small, portable weaponry.\n\n==Other versions==\n===MC2===\nRoderick Kingsley made his MC2 debut as a hired assassin to kill many of the Spider-Girl characters, including [[Normie Osborn]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], and Peter Parker.<ref>\'\'Spider-Girl\'\' #97</ref> After a fight against both Spider-Girl and her father, he came close to victory, but at the end his only success lay in killing the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], and also in escaping without a trace.<ref>\'\'Spider-Girl\'\' #100 (September 2006)</ref> He attempted a complex plot to become the new kingpin of crime, but was undone due to an act of treachery by his partner, the [[Mindworm]].
