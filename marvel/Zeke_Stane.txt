He\'s the open source to Stark\'s [[closed source]] oppressiveness. He has no headquarters, no base, and no bank account. He\'s a true [[ghost in the machine]]; completely off the grid, flexible, and mobile. That absolutely flies in the face of Tony\'s received business wisdom and in the way business is done.

Due to Stane\'s life off the grid, Iron Man fails to realize who he actually is, even with Stark\'s resources as Director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and Stane subsequently leaves California and prepares for the next stage in his vendetta against Stark.<ref>\'\'The Order\'\' #9-10</ref>\n\nFraction would follow \'\'The Order\'\' with a new monthly on-going \'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' title, with Zeke Stane appearing in its first story arc "The Five Nightmares" to further his vendetta against Tony Stark.<ref>\'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' #4-7</ref> Zeke is first seen attending a meeting with the Board of Directors of a big tobacco company who had hired him to tweak their tobacco to produce a higher basal metabolic rate in the people who smoked it: in layman\'s terms, they wanted him to invent a cigarette that would make users lose weight. Stane reveals he did succeed in doing it, but that he only took the job to use the company\'s money to make upgrades for the biotechnology he put in himself, upgrading his own [[hypothalamus]] to utilize energy within the body, that Stane swiftly uses to execute the board of directors with energy blasts from his finger tips. Stane is then updated by his girlfriend/assistant [[Sasha Hammer|Sasha]] on his upgraded [[Africa]]n [[suicide bombers]] who were test subjects of Stane\'s biotechnology.<ref name="IIM1">\'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' vol. 5, #1 (July 2008)</ref> The attacks of his suicide bombers were something that neither Iron Man nor [[War Machine]] could have predicted. Stane meets with Stark a second time (with Stane saying his name to Stark) during a party moments before suicide bombers appeared and self-destructed. Stark was able to summon his Iron Man armor while Stane just stood there with a disturbing smile. The explosion also severely injured [[Pepper Potts]] in the process.<ref>\'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' #20</ref>\n\nStane ultimately confronts Stark with his own unique armor, while also using terrorists armed with his technology to attack Stark Industries facilities around the world. However, Stark defeats Stane\'s plan with his control of all of his various Iron Man armors, allowing him to be in multiple locations and neutralize all of Stane\'s bombs at once. Stark then disables all of Stane\'s tech and both of their armors with electromagnetic pulses and defeats the younger man in hand-to-hand combat. Stark delivers the final emotional blow to the defeated Stane by telling him that "your father [Obadiah] was smarter than you. And harder to beat." However, Stark is left disturbed by Stane\'s attack, particularly with the notion of what he may have to become in order to face the future Stane represents.<ref>\'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' #25-28</ref>\n\nZeke Stane had been visited a few times in his prison sentence and was "paroled" by the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], Sasha\'s father, to now employ Zeke with Tony Stark being informed after the fact.<ref>\'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' #500</ref> Later, Zeke used a photo of the Iron Man armor in short cut at the \'\'[[Daily Bugle]]\'\' and make it look like the hero was drunk. Also, Zeke planned along with Mandarin to use classic villains of the Armored Avenger against him, such as [[Chemistro]], [[Living Laser]] and [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]].<ref>\'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' #510-513</ref>\n\nMandarin became increasingly discontent when Stane could not build [[Dreadnought (comics)|Dreadnoughts]] and Titanomechs on impossible schedules and nonexistent budgets. He started affecting Stane with his ring, making him obsessed with the work. Irked by this, Stane managed to remove his bomb implant and face off against Mandarin. However, Mandarin cranked up the ring\'s effect, making Stane his slave, causing increasing brain damage in the process. After the Mandarin succeeded in bringing Stark under his control, Tony and Zeke worked together to produce the Titanomechs.<ref>\'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' #520</ref>\n\nAfter Mandarin used 3 of his rings to power the first Titanomech, Tony started a plan with Zeke where they convinced super villains [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], [[Blizzard (Marvel Comics)|Blizzard]] II and Living Laser to join him in a rebellion with the final purpose of defeating Mandarin, and managed to use the technology in his body to help Resilient to find him, using microbots known as the Swarm, which tracked the repulsor technology of Tony\'s body. Resilient asked for help to the Triumph Division and the Dynasty to help Tony defeat Mandarin and his Titanomech. After Tim Cababa managed to reactivate the Extremis virus inside Stark\'s body, Tony created a link with the Swarm, and use them as bombs to destroy Mandarin\'s weapons, who in the end was killed by Stane.<ref>\'\'Invincible Iron Man\'\' #525</ref>\n\nAs part of the \'\'[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]\'\', Zeke Stane represented Stane International when he attended a meeting at the Universal Bank with [[Tiberius Stone]] of Alchemax, [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] of Fisk Industries, [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] of Shaw Industries, [[Darren Cross]] of [[Cross Technological Enterprises]], [[Silver Samurai|Shingen Harada]] of the Yashida Corporation, Frr\'dox of Shi\'ar Solutions Consolidated, and Wilhelmina Kensington of Kilgore Arms where they discussed with [[Minotaur (comics)|Dario Agger]] about his and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]\'s plans to exploit the Ten Realms of Asgard. Zeke Stane also saw the arrival of Exterminatrix of the Midas Foundation who knocked out Dario and declared herself a new member of their assembly.<ref>\'\'Mighty Thor\'\' Vol. 2 #8</ref>\n\nHe is also revealed to be the financial backer of a rebellion against [[Black Panther (comics)|T\'Challa]] in [[Wakanda]]<ref>Black Panther Vol. 6 #4</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nZeke Stane\'s genius-level intellect and considerable fortune has allowed him to cannibalize and reverse engineer Stark Tech from the [[black-market]] to upgrade his own [[biology]], most notably his [[hypothalamus]]. Stane successfully reduced the caloric energy consumption of his body from 70% to 9% leaving him surplus energy which he uses in repulsor bolts at the end of his fingers. Other upgrades have allowed his body to vastly repair itself from injury. Despite his high intelligence, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] claims that Stane is imitative rather than innovative, as all his inventions are merely re-purposed Stark tech rather than anything he developed completely on his own. Reed uses the example that the man who invented the [[sandwich]] simply put together what already existed to produce something good rather than developing his own idea – a fault which Iron Man exploits to ultimately defeat him. However, the fact his enhancements almost defeated Iron Man makes this seem more like Richards trying to demoralize Stane than an actual, honest assessment of his intellect. Especially considering that, so far, Stane\'s biomechanical technology seems unique and both Richards and Stark have never shown the ability to reproduce it on any wide scale.\n\nThis excessive use of the body\'s energy has shown that Stane must constantly keep his body\'s blood sugar level high to make up for its rapid consumption. Stane does this by eating a high (20,000) [[calorie]] paste.<ref name="IIM1"/>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\nEzekiel Stane appears in the \'\'[[Marvel Future Avengers]]\'\' episode "Secret Past of Iron Man", voiced by Yohei Azakami in Japanese and [[Benjamin Diskin]] in English.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Behind The Voice Actors – Marvel Future Avengers |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Marvel-Future-Avengers/voice-credits/ |website=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref>\n\n===Film===\n* While developing the story and rewriting [[Zak Penn]]\'s script for the 2012 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) film \'\'[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]\'\', director [[Joss Whedon]] became "worried" that [[Tom Hiddleston]]\'s [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] would not be enough of a match for the Avengers, leading him to write a draft featuring Ezekiel Stane as a supporting antagonist since his father [[Obadiah Stane (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Obadiah Stane]] was previously killed in the 2008 MCU film \'\'[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]\'\'.
