John was a powerful teleporter, capable of getting the team out of sticky situations after their job was finished. He had a penchant for explosives, arming himself with shaped charges, explosives that were built to direct the force of their blast in specific directions based on how they are deployed. Like the other members of Team X, he was given an artificial age suppressant so he was likely much older than he looked. His time as a secret agent and a member of the Weapon X program left John somewhat paranoid. His house was a veritable death trap, as was the yard around it; John trusted no one.<ref name=W60-66>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 2 #60–66</ref>\n\nHe made a habit of keeping his skill a secret from his compatriots as well as his foes, using it only sparingly, and if no one was looking directly at him — unless it was absolutely vital. The only time when his fellow Team-X members found out about his powers was when they went up against [[Omega Red]]. John was backup on that mission that Wolverine, Maverick, and Sabretooth ran in Germany to collect a carbonadium synthesizer, and when that trio burst out of the target compound with Red in pursuit, John stalled him with his gun until the others got away. Unfazed, Omega went to wrap John up and tear him to pieces, but John teleported to safety at the last second, with only Wolverine and Omega Red seeing this. There was also a certain animosity between him and Sabretooth. He was about as violent as his fellows from the Weapon X program, but a lot more merciful and didn\'t enjoy killing innocents while on a mission, which put him at odds with people like Sabretooth. Sabretooth once languished for quite a time in John\'s basement with several shaped charges strapped to his chest. Unless he had a really good reason to, Sabretooth wouldn\'t lift a finger to help John.<ref name=W60-66 />\n\nYears later, John had tracked Wolverine and the rest of his old teammates down because it seemed that there was a problem with the age suppression factors given to them by Weapon X, as one of their number, Mastodon, had suddenly aged quite rapidly and been reduced into a pile of ooze. With their help, John discovered a list of termination candidates from the Weapon X project. They uncovered themselves on the list plus a man named Aldo Ferro, who they knew was a big time mafia chief, Il Topo Siciliano. They tracked Ferro to his secluded island where they discovered Maverick guarding him. After Ferro\'s transformation caused [[Carol Hines]] to die of fright, Maverick soon changed sides when Ferro reveals that he had used his psi-powers to speed the false memory implantation of the Weapon X subjects. After this fiasco, John hung out with Wolverine for a month or two, but then vanished.<ref name=W60-66 />\n\nWraith was later re-recruited into Weapon X by the "[[Malcolm Colcord|Director]]" and his mission was to recruit Maverick as well. However, Maverick fought back and Wraith was shot and then had his neck broken by Sabretooth, who was planning on betraying the Program and couldn\'t trust Wraith. He was left for dead, but managed to survive.<ref>\'\'Weapon X\'\' #23</ref>\n\nJohn Wraith turns up alive and later became a preacher and was visited by Wolverine who confided in Wraith during soul-searching instigated by his being somewhat skeptical of his new start in life. However, a demon later possessed Wolverine\'s body (referred to as Hellverine) and lured Wraith into a trap by killing one of his parishioners. Whilst exiting the chapel and locking the parishioners inside so as to ensure they would not come to any more harm, Wraith armed himself with an [[assault rifle]] and set off to stop Logan\'s rampage only to be caught in one of his own traps, where he came face to face with Hellverine who managed to cast a spell of sorts on him, causing an assortment of deadly creatures (including scorpions and snakes) to crawl all over his body; seemingly killing him. Hellverine then directed its attention to Wraith\'s church (which was still locked with the parishioners inside) and used its demonic powers to set the building ablaze. Wraith emerged from nowhere and tried in vain to stop the demon, but was critically wounded by its claws. Helpless, Wraith could only watch as the parishioners were burned alive as he lay dying, as he was now depowered and could no longer teleport.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 4 #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWraith had the psionic ability to phase-jump; meaning he could seemingly disappear at will from any point in space and appear at another, with what would appear to be an exceptionally-high range. He could move about space at will, appearing and disappearing in a fashion that left no flashy burst of light or sound and he could even take others with him. He also had a life-extending serum in his blood, due to his involvement in the Weapon X program. He liked using "shaped charges," bombs whose blasts are precisely controlled.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|character_name=Colonel John Wraith\n|real_name=John Wraith \n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] ([[Ultimate Marvel]] Imprint)\n|debut=\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #2\n|creators= [[Mark Millar]]<br>[[Adam Kubert]]\n|alliances=[[Alpha Flight]]<br>[[Weapon X]]<br>[[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\n|aliases= [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Vindicator]], Colonel John Wraith\n|powers=flight<br>ability to fire energy blasts<br>teleport\n}}\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of the character is a Caucasian male. Colonel John Wraith was a mutant-hating commando who was in charge of the world\'s first mutant [[concentration camp]]. He was sanctioned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to head the barbaric [[Weapon X]] Program, which specialised in capturing mutants and forcing them to carry out covert missions for the US government. The program was co-headed by a [[Abraham Cornelius|Dr. Abraham Cornelius]]. He and his men (all who have anti-mutant sentiments as well) managed to capture and subject [[Canadians|Canadian]] para-trooper James "Lucky Jim" Howlett to experiments which wiped his memories clean and bonded his skeleton with Adamantium. They christened Howlett Weapon X and gave the fake name Logan. Wraith and his men enjoyed tormenting Logan by teasing with bits and pieces of lost memories and also caging and shooting Logan day and night since Logan could not die due to his own mutant healing factor. This conditioned Logan to become the perfect killing machine, or so they thought.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #2</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Gulf War]], they were transporting Logan in the desert, preparing for deployment, but the transport team was ambushed and Logan was accidentally set loose. Stumbling across a younger [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] taken by surprise by the same ambush, Logan rescued and brought Fury back to base camp. Colonel Wraith, surprised that Logan retained his humanity by not killing Fury, ordered his men to shoot and cage Logan once again. He told Fury not to worry about Logan since he was nothing more than a living weapon. A couple of years later, Fury returned the favor by helping Logan escape from the Weapon X facility.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #7–12</ref>\n\nWraith sent [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], another one of his mutant agents, after Logan but came back empty-handed. Wraith then began capturing other mutants to take Logan\'s place, mutants including [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and Cain Marko. When he received news that Logan headed back to America (as an assassin for [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] unknown to them), he and his men again attempted to recapture Logan, only to have their plans foiled by the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]]. Wraith\'s face was scarred by Logan\'s claws. In retribution, Wraith ordered the capture of the X-Men, but again he failed to catch Logan.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nHe had [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] hooked up to machines to harness the Professor\'s telepathy in order to help find other potential candidates for the program. The mutants imprisoned at the Weapon X facility were tortured on a daily basis; Rogue\'s arm was broken regularly and molten metal was poured on [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] to test durability. It was also during this time that [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] gets mutated even further by Dr. Cornelius. To keep them in line, Wraith had implanted micro explosives into them and if anyone got out of line or tried to escape, it was their friends who would pay the price.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #11</ref>\n\nThe X-Men\'s first major mission forced them to split up. One team was assigned to free Nick Fury having been captured by a foreign country, while the other team was assigned to destroy a new bio-weapon being developed by terrorists. [[Jean Grey]] was given the order to execute one of the scientists they had captured but refused. Wraith threatened to detonate [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]\'s implants for insubordination, at which point Jean is forced to kill someone for the very first time.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nWhen [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] threatened to phase out Weapon X, Wraith used Xavier to dispose of the General with a mental explosion. [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]] eventually gets captured, but had secretly led the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood]] to the facility in an attempt of freeing the imprisoned mutants. When the mutants began to break free, Wraith shot Xavier and attempted to flee in a helicopter. The [[Blob (comics)|Blob]] held onto Wraith\'s helicopter, but eventually loses grip. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] tried to zap Wraith with lightning, but Nightcrawler saved the Colonel who in turn tried to kill Nightcrawler. Fury killed Wraith and declared that all the mutants at the facility were free to go.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #38</ref>\n\nCanadian government forces saved Wraith\'s life by injecting him with the Banshee drug, and he was made leader of [[Alpha Flight]]. He also gained superpowers. Wraith decided to call himself "[[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|Vindicator]]". His team went to retrieve [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], which led the X-Men to find out that Wraith\'s team all use Banshee.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #94</ref> After the [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum wave]], Rogue sought out Wraith after finding out his identity during a previous battle when some of the X-Men went to rescue Northstar. Rogue convinced him to help kill [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]. He needed a few more people to help with this mission, so he and Rogue captured Sabretooth and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] to reform Weapon X.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #98–99</ref> Wraith was later killed by [[William Stryker|Stryker]] after blasting a hole in his armor. <ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #99</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Kestrel is mentioned in \'\'[[X-Men: Evolution]]\'\'. In the episode "Target X", [[Omega Red]] references both Maverick and Kestrel to Wolverine, mentioning the latter during a rundown of Weapon X adversaries.\n* A character based on the Ultimate Marvel version of John Wraith appears in \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\': \'\'\'Colonel Moss\'\'\' (voiced by [[Michael Ironside]]). He is in charge of the [[Mutant Response Division]] and has a vendetta against [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as Moss has claw marks across his face thanks to Wolverine at some point in the past. He was a former head of [[Weapon X]] that worked under [[Professor Thorton]] and [[Abraham Cornelius]]. In the [[Days of Future Past|Sentinel-dominated future]], he is a [[cyborg]] who handles putting power dampeners on mutants in prisons. Whenever his biological half is compromised by a [[telepath]], his [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] mode would take over.\n\n===Film===\n* Recording artist [[Will.i.am]] (of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]) portrays John Wraith in the 2009 feature film \'\'[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]\'\'.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981136.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title= Reynolds, will.i.am join \'Wolverine\' | work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date= 19 February 2008 | first= Marc |last= Graser| access-date= 22 April 2015}}</ref>  This version is a teleporting mutant and a member of Team X alongside [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] (James "Logan" Howlett), [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed]], [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]], [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]], [[Chris Bradley]] and [[Blob (comics)|Fred Dukes]] under [[William Stryker]]\'s leadership. While initially loyal to the team, Wraith eventually quits the team due to morality issues as he and Logan didn\'t like what the team did but follows orders anyway (like abducting fellow mutants) and becomes a boxing manager. He appears to be the one member whom Logan fully trusts, being the first whom Logan pays a visit after many years. When Wolverine arrives for information about Stryker\'s base, Wraith tells him to ask an obese Dukes that he\'s boxing to keep in shape. Before giving Logan any information, Dukes challenges Logan to a boxing match. Logan wins thanks to the adamantium skeleton and Dukes directs him toward escaped captive [[Gambit (Marvel Comics)|Remy LeBeau]]. Wraith goes with Wolverine which leads them to a casino in Louisiana. Wraith guards the back, only to be confronted by Creed. Knowing that Creed killed Bradley as well as apparently Wade and Dukes, Wraith fights Creed despite Logan\'s wish to kill Creed personally. Wraith uses his teleportation ability to his advantage and manages to strike Creed multiple times, but Creed, predicting Wraith\'s move, eventually positions himself in exactly the right place to grab Wraith\'s spine as Wraith appears, mortally wounding him. Creed takes a sample of Wraith\'s blood and his teleportation ability is used for Weapon XI.<ref>[http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/features/wolverine_characters/wolverinecharacters_JohnWraith.jpg John Wraith as portrayed by Will.i.am in \'\'X-Men Origins: Wolverine\'\']</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* John Wraith appears in the \'\'[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]\'\' video game, voiced by [[Will.i.am]]. He first appears when Wolverine is rescuing him from the headquarters of [[Project Wideawake|Project: WideAwake]] with the aid of [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], during which it is implied that he is the father of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. He leads Logan to Team X colleague Frederick Dukes, then to Remy LeBeau, and covers the back of the casino. Victor Creed sneak attacks and kills Wraith.\n* Another character named Kestrel appears in the [[Marvel Strike Force]] mobile game.
