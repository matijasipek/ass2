Created by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Al Milgrom]], the character first appeared in \'\'[[Secret Wars II]]\'\' #5 (Nov. 1985). She then appeared as a member of [[X-Force]] and later as a member of [[Nextwave]]. She is mentally able to create variably-sized yellow orbs of pure energy that explode with concussive and destructive force. Since her first appearance, Tabitha has used a number of different codenames, including \'\'\'Time Bomb\'\'\', \'\'\'Boom-Boom\'\'\', \'\'\'Boomer\'\'\', and \'\'\'Meltdown\'\'\'. Tabitha is one of the mutants to have kept their powers after the 2005 "[[House of M]]" storyline.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Jim Shooter]] and [[Al Milgrom]], the character first appeared in \'\'[[Secret Wars II]]\'\' #5 (Nov. 1985), in which she and the [[Beyonder]] are the primary characters. She next appears as a main character in the 1987 limited series \'\'[[Fallen Angels (comics)|Fallen Angels]]\'\'. This led to her becoming a supporting character in the \'\'[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]\'\' series beginning with issue #11, which then led to a co-star role in the \'\'[[X-Terminators]]\'\' limited series.  Following this series, she appeared in \'\'The [[New Mutants]]\'\', initially guest-starring as a member of the X-Terminators, and eventually becoming a member of the titular group. The team then became [[X-Force]] and she remained a member of the team for most of the \'\'X-Force\'\' series. Sometime later, she appears as a member of [[Nextwave]] throughout the \'\'Nextwave\'\' series. Writer [[Warren Ellis]] said that he picked Boom-Boom to be in Nextwave because Boom-Boom is his favorite super hero name in the history of comics for its sheer oddness and silliness, and he loved it when she was in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' when [[Joe Madureira]] was the artist.\n\n{{quote|"I wanted a character who could blow things up," he said of his choice of Boom-Boom. "I was also looking for a team structure where the women outnumbered the men. I liked her [[white trash|white-trash]] criminal background, which had uses in the plot set-up. But mostly I wanted a character who could blow things up. I mean, these are characters who no-one at Marvel had any use for, and I could have been stopped at any time, Jen. But a skinny-ass blonde mutant with a [[kleptomania]]c streak had both plot and entertainment value to me. Especially when played against the others."<ref>[http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004065 Ellis& The Nextwave @ ComicCon.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530122147/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004065 |date=May 30, 2006 }}</ref>}}\n\nDespite the appearance of Nextwave characters in other Marvel titles, in 2006 Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] stated that Nextwave\'s setting was in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity.<ref>Gum, Wade (2006-07-01).

She is depicted as a rebellious but normal teenager and the daughter of divorced parents in her first appearance. Tabitha\'s [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers manifest at 13, and her parents immediately show their disgust, her father even beating her. She runs away from home, giving herself the alias "Time Bomb," and meets the cosmic entity known as the [[Beyonder]]. He brings her to [[Charles Xavier]], headmaster of the [[X-Mansion|School for Gifted Youngsters]], who ignores her to combat the Beyonder. Just before she can commit suicide over this second rejection, the Beyonder stops her, taking her with him on his cosmic trip. The Beyonder confronts the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], and at her behest, returns Tabitha to Earth. She helps the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] ambush the Beyonder. She leaves the battlefield when she learns that the Beyonder felt betrayed by the actions of "his only friend."<ref>\'\'Secret Wars II\'\' #5</ref>\n\n===Fallen Angels and X-Terminators===\nLiving on the streets, Tabitha becomes involved with Maurice "Tiger" Antonini and, after he threatens Tabitha and murders her friend Gina, she uses her powers to kill him. Then, the villain known as the [[Vanisher]] recruits her for his band of thieves, called the Fallen Angels, and she officially takes on her codename "Boom-Boom." She eventually betrays the Vanisher, calling in the help of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], whom she stays with afterward.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #11</ref> Tabitha\'s former teammate in the Fallen Angels, the alien [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]] kidnaps the Angels to her home planet, to be experimented on by her planet\'s scientists. Ultimately though, she can\'t go through with the plan and helps them escape. The Angels return to Earth and go their separate ways.<ref>\'\'Fallen Angels\'\' #3-8</ref> Tabitha is kidnapped by the Right, an anti-mutant organization. Tabitha, X-Factor, and other mutants regain their freedom.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #22-23</ref>\n\nWhen X-Factor wards [[Artie Maddicks]] and [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] are kidnapped by [[N\'astirh]]\'s demons, Tabitha joins her fellow X-Factor trainees in a mission to rescue them. Taking the situation less seriously than the others, Tabitha is quick to pronounce the five of them "the newest super-mutant team in town" and pick out costumes for them all. They adopt the name [[X-Terminators]].<ref>\'\'X-Terminators\'\' #1-4</ref>\n\n===New Mutants===\nFollowing two successful team-ups with the [[New Mutants]],<ref>\'\'X-Terminators\'\' #4, \'\'The New Mutants\'\' #73 and 76</ref> Tabitha and some members of the X-Terminators, [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]], [[Skids (comics)|Skids]], and [[Rictor]], join the group.<ref>\'\'The New Mutants\'\' #77</ref> During her time with the New Mutants, Tabitha falls in love with her teammate, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]]. When the team is transported to the mythical realm of Asgard, it is partially through Tabitha that the team is able to foil a plot to kill [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]]. There she becomes close friends with the wolf-prince [[Hrimhari]].<ref>\'\'The New Mutants\'\' #76-78</ref> They encounter the man known as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]],<ref>\'\'The New Mutants\'\' #89</ref> and when he starts to mentor the team, Tabitha gains greater control of her powers. Tabitha is captured by [[Stryfe]] and the [[Mutant Liberation Front]] but is rescued.<ref>\'\'The New Mutants\'\' #93-94</ref>\n\nDuring "[[The X-Tinction Agenda]]" crossover, in which the country of [[Genosha]] attacks mutants in the United States, the Genoshan Magistrates kidnap Boom-Boom and her teammates Rictor, Wolfsbane, and Warlock, transporting them to Genosha.<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #270</ref> The incident receives international coverage, and Tabitha\'s father is interviewed, still voicing his disgust for his daughter.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #60</ref> Although stripped of their powers, she and Rictor escape.

During this time, Tabitha acts on her crush on Cannonball, and the two have a relationship. Although questioning the team\'s new methods, Tabitha sticks with the team, rechristening herself "Boomer." She battles the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] alongside her new team in one of their early missions.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #7, 9</ref>\n\nFollowing an attempted murder of [[Professor X]], mutual distrust places X-Force in conflict with the X-Men and X-Factor, and X-Force is apprehended.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #16</ref> Cannonball arranges for the team to be temporarily released so that they can help take down their arch-enemies, the [[Mutant Liberation Front]].<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #85</ref> Among the MLF are two of Boomer\'s former teammates in both the X-Terminators and New Mutants, Rusty and Skids, who breaks Boomer\'s jaw.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #15</ref> After X-Force\'s names are cleared, Tabitha is confronted by Cannonball\'s ex-girlfriend [[Lila Cheney]], who gives the couple her blessing.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #19</ref> Showing how serious he is, Cannonball takes Tabitha along for a vacation on his family\'s farm. During the stay, they are confronted by the [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]] and the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], and team up with the [[New Warriors]] to defeat them.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #32-33</ref><ref>\'\'The New Warriors\'\' #45-46</ref>\n\nEventually, the team\'s headquarters is blown up twice,<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #39</ref> and without a home, the team moves back into Xavier\'s mansion.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #43</ref> Shortly after, Cannonball graduates into becoming an X-Men member, and their relationship waters down.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #44</ref> Seeking comfort, Tabitha spends most of her time caring for the lobotomized Sabretooth, also confiding in him.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #47</ref> Her teammates attempt an unsuccessful intervention.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #48</ref>\n\nSabretooth reveals that he is faking the ordeal however, and fully healed, escapes by deceiving Tabitha into destroying his bonds.<ref name=autogenerated2>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #328 (Jan. 1996)</ref> In his escape, he eviscerates the X-Man [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]], who barely survives her wounds.<ref name=autogenerated2/>\n\n[[Image:4604-64525-1-x-force 400.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover to \'\'X-Force\'\' #51, featuring the revamped Tabitha Smith.

He got back in touch with [[Pete Wisdom]], and together they devised a plan for reactivating X-Force as a covert strike team. Meltdown, along with [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]] and [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]], agreed to enter into this new arrangement, and they took up residence in an abandoned Nevada Hulkbuster base for extensive retraining for martial combat and the use of their powers. In particular, Tabitha learned how to direct the explosive force of her power into streams of guided energy, and was also heavily trained in computer hacking and manipulating digital information. The revamped X-Force fought the shadow wars that other people couldn\'t even see, against the likes of meat-spore storm-troopers, mutagenic bioreactors, and assassins who carried the mutant gene for murder. After she almost lost Sam to that last threat, Meltdown confessed she couldn\'t bear to see him die, and the two of them became lovers again. While most of their missions were successful, they weren\'t without their share of troubles - Wisdom was apparently killed on their first mission back in San Francisco since leaving, and on two separate occasions their enemies tried to kill them in massive explosions.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #102-115</ref>\n\nThe team\'s undercover status turned out to be a weakness, though, for some new organization consisting of mutants that wanted to get rich and famous thought the name was up for grabs. After buying legal rights to use "X-Force" as their name, this group went public and soon became popular. When the original X-Force learned of this, they came out of hiding and confronted the new guys about the name and violating the original concept behind the team, it was already too late. Apparently, the original X-Force disbanded after this, retreating from their recent hardcore offensive stance on mutant issues. Sam and Tabitha also went their separate ways.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #117</ref>\n\n===\'\'Weapon X\'\' and the \'\'X-Force\'\' mini===\nWhen [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] discovers hints regarding the existence of a revamped [[Weapon X]] program, one designed to use mutants to hunt down and intern other mutants, he creates an organization to investigate the program and the existence of its internment camp, Neverland. He dubs the organization the Underground and invites Meltdown to join his elite group. Ultimately, Cable\'s Underground group is joined by Weapon X agent [[Brent Jackson]], who hopes to stage a coup against the project\'s Director and has formed his own resistance group with fellow agents [[Washout (comics)|Washout]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], and [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]]. Jackson betrays the Underground team however after the coup is successful and alters/wipes their memories of the events.<ref>\'\'Weapon X\'\' #12</ref>\n\nSometime thereafter, Cable learns of another threat to mutant-kind, the voracious creatures known as the [[Skornn]], a creature that was going to threaten Earth. He gathers and reunites X-Force to deal with them. Meltdown is among the former members he recruits. While both Cannonball and Sunspot are also involved in the conflict, Tabitha\'s feelings for either weren\'t brought up. However, she reveals to have learned a new trick with her mutant powers when she channeled one of her time bombs through Shatterstar\'s blade straight into the chest of a seemingly unbeatable opponent. After the Skornn was also defeated, some of X-Force remained together, assisting Cable on Providence, an island nation he created. Afterward, she helps them attack the headquarters of the Black Box, though the occupant turns out to be a robot. <ref>\'\'Cable & Deadpool\'\' #18</ref>\n\nTabitha is one of the few mutants who retain her powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].<ref>\'\'X-Men: The 198 Files\'\' #1</ref>\n\n===\'\'Nextwave\'\'===\nShortly afterward, after an initial period of wild arrogance, Tabitha seems to mellow out and settle back into her earlier, more bubbly personality. She even develops a tendency to use chat room-like shorthand when speaking out loud, such as "[[SMS language#Common acronyms|OMG]]," "ZOMG," and "OH NOES!"  She also begins to start saying "Tick, tick, tick-- BOOM!" when using her powers. Tabitha also grows her hair long and eschewed her codename and re-appears as a founding member of [[Nextwave]], a new off-beat and more than slightly satirical super-hero team featured in an eponymous comic book series created by [[Warren Ellis]] and [[Stuart Immonen]]. The Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort, or [[H.A.T.E.]] (a subsidiary of the [[Beyond CorporationÂ©]]) formed the team. Tabitha Smith\'s new team includes other second-string characters taken from Marvel limbo, including [[Monica Rambeau]] (formerly Captain Marvel, the leader of the Avengers), [[Elsa Bloodstone]], [[Machine Man|Aaron Stack]], and a new character [[Captain (comics)|The Captain]].{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nEverything seemed on the up and up until Tabitha began snooping around, and discovered the marketing plan of the Beyond Corporation, H.A.T.E.\'s financial backers. It turned out that Beyond Corp evolved out of the former terrorist cell known as S.I.L.E.N.T., and was planning to use H.A.T.E. and Nextwave to further its own sinister agendas.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Tabitha brought the files she stole to the squad leader, Pulsar, and Nextwave hijacked a Shockwave Rider transport ship and defected from H.A.T.E.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Tabitha and the others fought against their former employers, and defended the country from the unusual [[weapons of mass destruction|WMDs]] unleashed by the Beyond Corporation on the general populace; the first biological weapon was revealed to be [[Fin Fang Foom]], a giant lizard which clambered from underground and proceeded to wreck the building site.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nAfter putting an end to the threat of Fin Fang Foom in [[North Dakota|Abscess, North Dakota]], Nextwave moved on to [[Illinois]]. Tabitha manages to subdue Mac Mangel, a corrupt police officer who had been taken as a host by the Ultra Samurai Seed. The Ultra Samurai metallic shell disintegrates, leaving Mangel crushed. Upon learning that he was a police officer, Tabitha and Aaron began to beat Mangel before Rambeau intervened.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe team was later attacked by The New Paramounts, a team consisting of \'\'[[Not Brand Echh]]\'\' characters including [[Forbush Man]], The Inedible Bulk and Charlie America. Forbush Man attempted to use his mind control powers on Tabitha, but was shocked to find they didn\'t work on her as she apparently has no mind. Tabitha subsequently killed Forbush Man, saving her teammates. When they awoke, she explained "The little guy did something to your heads. I gave him the explodo because I am clever."{{issue|date=November 2011}} Not long after, they eventually exposed and destroyed the true mastermind behind S.I.L.E.N.T.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Manifest Destiny===\n{{Main|X-Men: Manifest Destiny}}\nTabitha moves to San Francisco to help with the X-Men\'s new relocation plans, and resumes using the codename Boom-Boom. While shopping in San Francisco she confronts the mutant [[Nuwa (comics)|Nuwa]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&id=943 X-Men: Manifest Destiny #1 preview], [[Comic Book Resources]]</ref> Forced by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] to confront Nuwa through research, instead of strength alone, she discovers - using a thinly veiled parody of [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]]<ref>[http://www.readaboutcomics.com/2008/09/10/x-men-manifest-destiny-1/ Read About Comics Â» X-Men: Manifest Destiny #1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> called \'\'FaceSpace\'\' - the true nature of Nuwa\'s sedation powers, then nullifies them by consuming large quantities of [[stimulant]]s, namely the [[caffeine]] in an unspecified number of [[espresso]]s.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Manifest Destiny\'\' #1</ref>\n\n===Kidnapping, death and salvation===\nTabitha is later kidnapped along with Surge and Hellion by the Leper Queen and her Sapien League. The Leper Queen attempts to inject her with a modified version of the Legacy Virus, a virus which had been cured years before that afflicted mostly mutants, when the members of X-Force arrive to try and save her, Surge and Hellion. After Cyclops refuses to wait long enough for Wolverine and Domino to kill the Leper Queen, they are sent through time to help Cable, leaving the Leper Queen and Tabitha all alone. The Leper Queen reveals to Tabitha that she had intended using X-Force to kill her, since Bastion will not let her commit suicide and that the plan was for Wolverine to kill her and rescue Tabby. The Leper Queen shoots Tabitha between the eyes, saying that X-Force "failed them both."<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' vol. 3 #13</ref> After X-Force\'s mission in the future is complete, [[X-23]] emerges from the timestream seconds before the Leper Queen is about to kill Tabitha and shoots her in the head.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' vol. 3 #17</ref> With the Leper Queen dead and Boom-Boom saved, X-23 collapses in exhaustion just as a team of [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (comics)#H.A.M.M.E.R.|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents storm the building, providing Tabitha with medical care while taking X-23 into custody. The agents are given the order to take a genetic sample from Tabitha and then kill her, but one agent plans to rape her before killing her. She is saved from death yet again by Warpath, who kills the agents before they are able to defile her and takes her to the X-Force safehouse to see if she remembers anything else about her kidnapping.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #18</ref>\n\n===Utopia===\nBoom-Boom is later seen during the events of "[[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]]," amongst the mutants assembled in [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]\'s chapel as they all prepare to abandon San Francisco for the base that the X-Club has raised from the bottom of the ocean. She is among the first group of mutants teleported by [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]] to the new base.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #8 (2009)</ref> Boom-Boom was also one of the X-Men who defeated the invading Predator Xs who attacked Utopia.

These "time bombs" explode with concussive force. She can produce marble-sized energized "bombs" which have little concussive impact and which she uses for playing pranks. She has produced "time bombs" ranging up to the size of beach balls, which are able to destroy durable objects including a [[Predator X (comics)|Predator X]],<ref>\'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' #517</ref> and a futuristic [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]].<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' vol. 3 #14</ref> Tabitha can also control the amount of time before detonation. Finally, she can mentally muffle the sound of the detonation.\n\nShe is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, coached in unarmed combat by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}} She loves video games and is an accomplished thief, having been trained by the [[Vanisher]].{{Issue|date=January 2011}}\n\nUnder the direction of [[Pete Wisdom]] she learns to focus her power as streams of concussive force.<ref>First used in issue \'\'X-Force\'\' #102, and recap of training seen in issue \'\'X-Force\'\' #107</ref>\n\nIn \'\'Nextwave\'\', her mutant abilities are summarized as "the mutant ability to blow things up and steal all your stuff".{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} She also has access to technological support, such as jetpacks.
