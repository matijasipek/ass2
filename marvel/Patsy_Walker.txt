Don\'t come into \'\'Patsy Walker: Hellcat\'\' expecting deep, nuanced characterization. Just expect to have plenty of fun, more than many series can offer in an entire arc. I was disappointed, though certainly not surprised, to learn that Stuart Immonen would not be returning to illustrate his wife\'s work. Luckily, David la Fuente is a more than capable replacement. His style perfectly captures the wonky tone and expressive, vibrant feel of the original story. As a fashion model, half of drawing Patsy Walker is capturing her many colorful outfits. Far too many artists have problems with rendering clothing not made of spandex. La Fuente is not one of them.  It\'s a slow week, with only one \'\'Secret Invasion\'\' tie-in to be found.

When every story tries to be an epic tale about how a heroâs greatest struggle, it becomes easy to lose sight of how a world as sprawling as Marvelâs logically fits together. On some level, Marvel understands the intrinsic appeal of these kinds of focused stories that are a touch off the traditional âmainstreamâ comics path. But like \'\'Mockingbird\'\', \'\'Vision\'\', and Nighthawk, before it, \'\'Patsy Walker\'\'âs coming to a premature end, seemingly because Marvelâs less interested in putting out thoughtful indies in an industry addicted to formulaic blockbusters. \'\'Patsy Walker\'\' isnât a small story, or a simple one, but rather one with a solid focus on a couple of months in one womanâs during which some really important things happen around her.

The vast majority of the story puts the spotlight on Patsy, throwing her into a literally hellish confrontation with her past. It\'s always a joy to read Christopher Cantwell\'s essentially-solo stories for Patsy, and having her world be explored throughout this issue is an entertaining joy, especially when coupled with Ruairi Coleman\'s excellent art. This issue is definitely a turning point for both Tony and Patsy â and a great one at that."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Magnett |first=Chase |date=June 29, 2022 |title=Comic Book Reviews for This Week: 6/29/2022 |url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/new-comic-reviews-dc-marvel-image-june-29-2022/ |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=ComicBook.com |language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n* In 2015, \'\'[[Entertainment Weekly]]\'\' ranked Hellcat 74th in their "Let\'s rank every Avenger ever" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Franich |first=Darren |date=April 29, 2015 |title=Let\'s rank every Avenger ever |url=https://ew.com/article/2015/04/29/lets-rank-every-avenger-ever/ |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=Entertainment Weekly |language=en}}</ref>\n* In 2017, \'\'[[Gizmodo]]\'\' ranked Hellcat 13th in their "Marvel Superheroes Who Basically Only Protect New York City" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Whitbrook |first=James |last2=Pulliam-Moore |first2=Charles |date=August 18, 2017 |title=Marvel Superheroes Who Basically Only Protect New York City, Ranked |url=https://gizmodo.com/marvel-superheroes-who-basically-only-protect-new-york-1797953197 |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=Gizmodo |language=en}}</ref>\n* In 2018, \'\'[[Comic Book Resources]]\'\' ranked Hellcat 17th in their "Marvel\'s 20 Most Seasoned Street-Level Heroes" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Walker |first=Gary |date=November 20, 2018 |title=On Patrol: Marvel\'s 20 Most Seasoned Street-Level Heroes, Ranked |url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-street-level-heroes-ranked/ |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=Comic Book Resources |language=en-US}}</ref>\n* In 2020, [[Sideshow Collectibles|\'\'Sideshow\'\']] ranked Hellcat 7th in their "Top-Ten Cat-Themed Comic Book Characters" list.<ref name=":1" />\n* In 2020, \'\'[[Comic Book Resources]]\'\' ranked Hellcat 1st in their "Marvel: 10 Best Golden Age Heroines" list.<ref name=":0" />\n* In 2021, \'\'[[Screen Rant]]\'\' ranked Hellcat 9th in their "10 Best Versions Of Hawkeye From Marvel Comics" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Harn |first=Darby |date=August 12, 2021 |title=10 Best Versions Of Hawkeye From Marvel Comics |url=https://screenrant.com/best-versions-hawkeye-clint-barton-marvel-comics/ |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=Screen Rant |language=en-US}}</ref>\n* In 2022, \'\'[[Gizmodo]]\'\' ranked Hellcat 5th in their "12 Marvel Villains Who Should Have Been in \'\'Thunderbolts\'\'" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bricken |first=Rob |date=September 14, 2022 |title=12 Marvel Villains Who Should Have Been in Thunderbolts |url=https://gizmodo.com/thunderbolts-movie-marvel-villains-zemo-bullseye-agatha-1849531283 |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=Gizmodo |language=en}}</ref>\n* In 2022, \'\'[[Screen Rant]]\'\' included Hellcat in their "10 Iconic New York City-Based Marvel Superheroes We Haven\'t Seen In The MCU" list<ref name=":2" /> and in their "She-Hulk: 10 Comics Characters Who Should Appear In The Series" list.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wildsmith |first=Steve |date=January 13, 2022 |title=She-Hulk: 10 Comics Characters Who Should Appear In The Series |url=https://screenrant.com/she-hulk-comics-characters-should-appear-in-series/ |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=Screen Rant |language=en-US}}</ref>\n* In 2022, \'\'[[Comic Book Resources]]\'\' ranked Hellcat 4th in their "10 Most Powerful Members Of The Lady Liberators" list<ref>{{Cite web |last=Etemesi |first=Philip |date=August 31, 2022 |title=She-Hulk: 10 Most Powerful Members Of The Lady Liberators, Ranked |url=https://screenrant.com/she-hulk-strongest-lady-liberators-members/ |access-date=October 30, 2022 |website=Screen Rant |language=en-US}}</ref> and 5th in their "10 Best Cat-Themed Superheroes In Comics" list.<ref name=":3" />\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nPatsy Walker has appeared in Marvel Comics\' [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]].

By the end of the [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|second season]], Walker volunteers to undergo experimentation carried out by Dr. [[Karl Malus]]. Despite nearly dying in the process, she acquires enhanced strength, endurance, agility, balance, vision, and reflexes as well as razor-sharp nails. In between the second and [[Jessica Jones (season 3)|third seasons]], she began training excessively and used her newly acquired powers to become proficient in acrobatics and gymnastics while also seeking to develop her investigative skills like Jones. Throughout the aforementioned third season, Walker goes from being a vigilante to a self-described "supervillain". Consumed by the loss of her mother at the hands of serial killer [[Gregory Sallinger]], she gives in to her rage and begins brutally attacking, later murdering, individuals she deems as evil regardless of their actions or motivations under the belief that it is to make the world a better place. This leads to a confrontation between her and Jones, who is forced to apprehend Walker and turn her over to the authorities.
