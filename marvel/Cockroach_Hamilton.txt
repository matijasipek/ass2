As a child, Dontrell was petrified by the night\'s noise and would gradually become accustomed to them and the [[cockroach]]es that infested his home. Since then, he has developed an affinity for cockroaches and "Cheese Snipz".<ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe 2006 #5</ref>\n\nLater on in his life, Dontrell "Cockroach" Hamilton turned to a life of crime and became a mob enforcer for [[Piranha Jones|Ray "Piranha" Jones]].<ref>\'\'Power Man\'\' #28</ref>During an investigation of Dontrell, [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] is attacked by Dontrell and Ray\'s men at the Harlem River docks.

Power Man and Ray fall into a pool of piranhas, and Dontrell seals them in and escapes.<ref>\'\'Power Man\'\' #30-31</ref>\n\nDontrell and Ray escaped conviction and relocated to [[Stamford, Connecticut]]. As the locals wouldn\'t accept them for their demanding of protection from them, three women Vita Buchetta, Ann Repucci, and Annette Cortese shamed the community for accepting them while secretly drafting to use them to start their own criminal careers. When [[Terror Inc.]] was hired by an unknown party to kill Ray, Dontrell was unable to defend Ray because "Josh" kept jamming. Upon examining the information from the cartridges, Terror Inc. realized that Ray had hired them.
