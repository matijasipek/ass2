The cosmic entity [[Galactus]] selects Tyros as his next [[Herald of Galactus|Herald]], but first wishes for the [[superhero]] team the Fantastic Four to humble him. In return the cosmic entity agrees to travel to Earth to aid the heroes against a new threat, the villain [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)|Sphinx]]. Tyros is defeated, and brought before Galactus, who changes the petty tyrant into \'\'Terrax the Tamer\'\'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=190}}</ref> His minor control over stone was augmented to an incalculable degree. Now, he could affect all matter of rock and stone on nearly a planetary scale. His body was changed so that it would withstand the vacuum of space. Finally, Galactus gave Terrax a weapon called the cosmic axe capable of generating waves of cosmic force. Terrax travels with Galactus to Earth and, while his new master battles the Sphinx, attacks the Fantastic Four—still resenting the heroes for their role in his transformation. Terrax, however, is tricked and defeated by the [[Human Torch]], and leaves with a victorious Galactus.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #210–213 (Sep.–Dec. 1979)</ref>\n\n===Rebellion===\nAs Galactus\'s new herald, Terrax found more worlds for his master than any of the previous heralds. Terrax likened the discovery of new planets to the feeling of conquest. On several occasions, Terrax annihilated large segments of the population himself using his cosmic powers. As Galactus had hoped, Terrax\'s lack of morality made him a successful herald. But whereas Galactus\'s other heralds had a sense of loyalty to their master, Terrax had none. Indeed, he served Galactus out of fear for his master\'s power, but even conquered that fear on several occasions to defy Galactus\' wishes. Shortly after being transformed into Galactus\' herald, Terrax fled from his master and overthrew the ruling body of a small-unnamed planet. He enslaved the entire population and set himself up as the planet\'s deity. Huge segments of that world\'s people died erecting temples and cities to glorify Terrax. Terrax planned to use the survivors of his reign as the first wave of a planned universe conquering army. But before Terrax could proceed any further, Galactus summoned his herald. Fearful of his master\'s wrath, Terrax hid in a black hole. Utilizing the powers of the Earth mutant [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], Galactus freed Terrax and made him obedient to his will again.<ref>\'\'Dazzler\'\' #10–11 (Dec. 1981–Jan. 1982)</ref>\n\nTerrax reappears in the title \'\'[[Rom (comics)|Rom]]\'\', and after leading Galactus to the planet [[Galador (comics)|Galador]], battles its champion, Rom, and his fellow [[Spaceknight]], [[Terminator (Marvel Comics)|Terminator]].<ref>\'\'Rom\'\' #26–27 (Jan.–Feb. 1984)</ref>\n\nBut Terrax\'s rebellious nature could not be totally stifled, and after a while, Terrax again fled his master. This time, he went to Earth. Utilizing his power, Terrax levitated the entire island of Manhattan into earth orbit and used the lives of its millions of inhabitants to bargain with the Fantastic Four. To spare Manhattan, Terrax demanded that they destroy Galactus by attacking his ship. Galactus had by now realized that his herald had become a liability to him, Returning Manhattan to Earth, Galactus stripped Terrax of his cosmic power and the transformed alien was sent hurtling from the top of the World Trade Center down to the street below. Although seriously injured, Terrax\'s alien physique enabled him to survive the fall. An unidentified passerby took Terrax\'s broken form, unknown to both the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, who were present at the site, to a nearby hospital. He remained there for several months in a semi comatose state.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #242–243 (May–June 1982)</ref>\n\nVictor Von Doom, looking for a pawn to use in a plot against the Fantastic Four, discovered that Terrax had survived. Terrax was kidnapped from the hospital and brought back to Doom\'s kingdom of Latveria by a squad of robots dispatched by Doom. There, after six weeks of Doom\'s advanced treatments, Terrax recovered. But, having been stripped of cosmic power, Terrax had no memories of having been the herald of Galactus, and thus called himself Tyros once more. Doom had recently perfected a device that was capable of endowing an individual with limited cosmic power. Tyros readily agreed to be exposed to the device\'s energies, as he wished revenge against the Fantastic Four. Garbed in a special suit that would channel and regulate the cosmic energies in his body, Tyros set off for New York. Unknown to him, the power Doom gave him would consume Tyros\'s body within a matter of hours. Thus, Doom would not be faced with an adversary whose power was vaster than his own, once Tyros had served his purpose.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #258–259 (Sep.–Oct. 1983)</ref>\n\nTyros defeated the Fantastic Four at a shopping mall and, detesting the fact he was in the service of any master, he turned on Doom and immobilized the Latverian monarch in his armor. At Tyros\'s moment of seeming triumph, the Silver Surfer, the first of Galactus\'s heralds, arrived to save the lives of his friends. Tyros believed that his power level was equal to that of the Surfer\'s, but he soon learned that he was no match for someone who had received the Power Cosmic from Galactus himself. Tyros was forced to use his powers to their limit in order to combat the Surfer. This only served to hasten his inevitable deterioration. As the two former heralds of Galactus engaged in battle, Tyros was totally consumed by the Power Cosmic.<ref name=autogenerated1>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #260 (Nov. 1983)</ref> When Tyros and Silver Surfer crash to the ground, they land on and obliterate the helpless Doctor Doom.<ref name=autogenerated1/> Suddenly a shopper speaks arrogantly to an elderly woman, who turns out to be Spider-Man\'s Aunt May.

Terrax briefly fights him and refuses to evacuate the planet. Nova runs away as the threat he warned Terrax about arrives.

Like all Heralds, Terrax has immense strength, stamina, durability, speed, agility, reflexes, and lifespan, as well as hypersonic flight, energy control, and sustained metabolism. He wielded a cosmic axe, which it had several powers of its own.<ref>\'\'The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\'\' Vol 1 #14 (March 1984)</ref> <ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z\'\' Vol 1 #11 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===MC2===\nA future version of Terrax appears in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] title, \'\'[[Fantastic Five]]\'\'.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Five\'\' #1–2 (Sep. 2007); #3–4 (Oct. 2007); #5 (Nov. 2007)</ref>\n\n===Terrax the Truly Enlightened===\nIn "Earth-TRN267," Terrax was also a herald of Galaktus and called himself "Terrax the Truly Enlightened". When this Earth started to collide with Earth-616 due to an Incursion, the Illuminati traveled to that reality to see if they could save the people there before destroying the world. They found that Terrax had already guided Galaktus of that universe to destroy it in order to save his universe. Terrax demanded the Illuminati retreat to their home reality, but they refused, and Terrax attacked them. Terrax was eventually defeated and captured but not in time to stop Galactus, who consumed the Earth-TRN267, averting in the process the Earth-616\'s destruction.<ref>\'\'The New Avengers\'\' vol.3 #4</ref>\n\nTerrax was taken to Earth-616 and was imprisoned in the Necropolis of Wakanda in a cell next to [[Black Swan (comics)|Black Swan]]\'s, where she later suggested that he would soon have an interest in teaming up with her.<ref>\'\'The New Avengers\'\' vol. 3 #6</ref> Terrax joins the [[Cabal (comics)#The New Cabal|New Cabal]] to destroy Earths that are colliding with Earth-616.<ref>\'\'The New Avengers\'\' vol. 3 #23</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Terrax appeared in the \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' TV series, voiced by [[Tony Jay]] in season one and [[Ron Feinberg]] in season two. In the episode "Silver Surfer and the Coming of Galactus" Pt. 2, Galactus summons Terrax and Firelord to hold off three of the Fantastic Four while he assembles his machine that will enable him to consume Earth. Terrax fought Thing in battle. Once Galactus finished assembling the device, he sent Terrax and Firelord away. In the episode "To Battle the Living Planet", Terrax was seen with Galactus when the Fantastic Four arrive to beg Galactus to help them defeat Ego the Living Planet. In the episode "When Calls Galactus", Terrax tricks Galactus into consuming a poisonous planet and then tries to manipulate the Fantastic Four into finishing off Galactus while in his sick and vulnerable state. The Fantastic Four ultimately choose to help Galactus instead and defeat Terrax.  As punishment for Terrax\'s treachery, Galactus transforms Terrax into a colony of earthworms, which Galactus banishes to Earth.\n* Terrax appears in \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\', voiced by [[Ted Biaselli]]. In the episode "Last Exit Before Doomsday", he is seen as one of the Heralds of Galactus.\n* Terrax appears in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\', voiced by [[Kevin Grevioux]]. In the episode "Avengers Assemble!", he is seen as one of the Heralds of Galactus and is depicted as an Earth construct rather than an actual alien. Terrax was the first of the Heralds of Galactus to arrive and single-handedly took down the Avengers. The Avengers called in their allies to help fight the Heralds of Galactus as Captain America leads Iron Fist, Quake, Spider-Man, and War Machine to fight Terrax. He is destroyed by Iron Fist and Captain America.\n* Terrax appears in the [[Disney XD]] Marvel series, voiced by [[James C. Mathis III]]. \n** Terrax appears in \'\'[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]\'\'. In the episode "Galactus Goes Green", he appears on Earth where he prepares it for Galactus\' consumption at the time when the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. are in Las Vegas. After Terrax is defeated by She-Hulk, Galactus takes away Terrax\'s Power Cosmic and bestows it upon She-Hulk transforming her into the Emerald Emissary. During the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.\'s fight with Galactus, She-Hulk later sought out Terrax and battled him in order to make a deal with him. When Terrax and She-Hulk\'s battle brings it near Galactus, She-Hulk is defeated by Terrax causing Galactus to reinstate him after returning She-Hulk to normal. Unbeknownst to Galactus, She-Hulk actually took a dive during the fight. As Galactus leaves to consume another planet, the deal that She-Hulk made for Terrax was for him to have Galactus consume uninhabited planets that Terrax happens to find. In the episode "Planet Hulk" Pt. 2, Firelord mentions in his battle with the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. that Terrax has failed Galactus. It is implied by Firelord that he used his fire attack on Terrax.\n** Terrax appears in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episode "Contest of Champions" Pt. 3, where the Grandmaster pairs him up with [[Attuma]] and [[Annihilus]] against [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]\'s team of Spider-Man, [[Amadeus Cho|Iron Spider]], [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], and Thor.\n\n===Video games===\n* Terrax appears as a boss in the Game Boy Advance Game: Fantastic 4 - Flame On.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* Terrax also appears in the [[video game]] \'\'[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (video game)|Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\'\', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].\n\n===Toys===\n* Terrax was released as a build-a-figure in the [[Marvel Legends]] toyline in January 2012,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mureview.net/?p=142 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-10 |archive-date=2012-09-05 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120905094614/http://www.mureview.net/?p=142 |url-status=dead }}</ref> later being rereleased in a multipack in 2023.{{cn|date=August 2022}}\n* A Terrax [[Minimate]] will be featured in the [[Toys R Us]] exclusive \'\'Heralds of Galactus\'\' boxset.<ref>[http://www.artasylum.com/blog/2011/09/final-heralds-of-galactus-minimates-box-set-line-up-revealed/ Minimate announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924030211/http://www.artasylum.com/blog/2011/09/final-heralds-of-galactus-minimates-box-set-line-up-revealed/ |date=2011-09-24 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/t/terrax.htm Terrax] at Marvel Directory\n* [https://www.marvel.com/characters/terrax Terrax] at Marvel.com\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Tyros_(Earth-616) Terrax] at Marvel Database\n* [https://comicvine.gamespot.com/terrax/4005-2016/ Terrax] at Comic Vine\n* [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=33760 \'\'Grand Comics Database\'\'\'s article on the Fantastic Four issue containing Terrax\'s debut]\n\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n{{New Warriors}}\n{{Silver Surfer}}\n{{X-Men}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne (comics)]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1979]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with earth or stone abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with slowed ageing]]\n[[Category:Fictional dictators]]\n[[Category:Fictional swordfighters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]'}]}}}}
