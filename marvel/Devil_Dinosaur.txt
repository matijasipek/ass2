Kirby writes: "\'\'After all, just where the Dinosaur met his end, and when Man first stood reasonably erect, is still shrouded in mystery\'\'". Writers subsequent to Kirby have approached the character\'s origin in various ways. Some have followed Kirby\'s lead and portrayed the character as being from the prehistoric past of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|main Marvel continuity]] (sometimes referred to as "[[Earth-616]]"), while others have depicted Devil as hailing from either an alien planet or an alternate reality Earth. Marvel\'s most recent publications list Devil\'s home of origin as "Dinosaur World ([[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#Alternate Universes|Earth-78411]])", a primitive version of Earth existing in one of the many alternative universes contained within the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Multiverse]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters\'\' #1 (November 2005)</ref>\n\nThe first appearance of Devil Dinosaur after the cancellation of the original series was in Marvel\'s \'\'[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters (comic book)|Godzilla, King of the Monsters]]\'\' of 1979.<ref>\'\'Godzilla, King of Monsters\'\' #21-22 (April - May 1979)</ref> The character was not to be referenced again in a Marvel comic until 1986 when the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] of the [[Fantastic Four]] travels to a Pacific island where "\'\'Devil Dinosaur: The Movie\'\'" is being produced.

Devil is found fiercely guarding a nest containing a clutch of eggs that apparently he himself has laid and the dinosaur abandons Moon-Boy to ensure their safety.

Refusing to eat, or defend himself, he was in danger of dying. However, [[Stegron]], the dinosaur man, became worried about the survival of the Devil-Beast due to it being the last known of its species. Leaving the Savage Land without the permission of [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] and building an army of reanimated dinosaurs, Stegron marched across the U.S. attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. base after base, until he was eventually stopped by the [[Fifty State Initiative]].

Moon Boy and Devil Dinosaur fought to reclaim it, but Moon Boy died as the Killer Folk were sucked into a vortex through time with the Nightstone. Moon Boy\'s dying wish was for Devil Dinosaur to reclaim the Nightstone and to avenge him.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #1</ref>\n\nGoing through the portal, Devil Dinosaur ended up in New York City. The Nightstone had fallen into the hands of [[Moon Girl (Marvel Comics)|Lunella Lafayette]] - a genius 9-year-old - who deduced the Nightstone was actually a Kree Omni-Wave Projector. Lunella had identified the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] gene within her own DNA and feared being transformed into a monster due to the changes brought about by [[Terrigen Mist]]. Due to several Terrigen clouds that had been drifting around the city following the Inhumans\' detonation of a Terrigen bomb, she took drastic action and intended to use the Nightstone to find a way to remove the Inhuman DNA. With Lunella refusing to give up the Nightstone, Devil Dinosaur was forced to bring her on his rampage through the city as he searched for the Killer Folk. Although Devil Dinosaur fought the Killer Folk, they managed to escape with the Nightstone.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #2</ref>\n\nLunella ended up harboring Devil Dinosaur in her laboratory that she had built in the depths of her school, growing more and more frustrated that she was stuck with the "big red dummy" but found him useful when he helped save the lives of her teacher and class during a fire.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #3</ref> However, the Hulk ([[Amadeus Cho]]) arrived, seeking to apprehend Devil Dinosaur for his earlier rampage and accused him of the fire. Lunella refused, declaring that she needed Devil Dinosaur and, growing frustrated with Amadeus patronizing her and undermining her intelligence, drew out a few homemade weapons to fight him, but only accidentally ended up knocking out Devil Dinosaur.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #4</ref>\n\nLunella, feeling responsible for Devil Dinosaur\'s arrest and, feeling kinship to the beast stuck in a place he did not belong, broke him out under the moniker of Moon Girl, a nickname the other students used to bully her.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #5</ref> After the Killer Folk - who had conquered territory previously owned by the [[Yancy Street Gang]] - failed to kidnap Lunella from school to be their blood sacrifice to the Nightstone on a full moon, Lunella decided to end things. She and Devil Dinosaur fought the Killer Folk once more and won, reclaiming the Nightstone. Lunella hoped she could finally use it to ensure she would not transform into an Inhuman, but at that precise moment she was caught in a Terrigen cloud.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #6</ref>\n\nDevil Dinosaur took Lunella\'s cocoon to her lab and watched over it for several days until she hatched. Lunella was at first relieved she had not changed physically, but was dismayed to learn her Inhuman power caused her consciousness and that of Devil Dinosaur\'s to switch. Devil Dinosaur proceeded to make her even more ostracized at school due to freaking out in class and attacking other students whilst Lunella rampaged through the city. Eventually though they returned to normal.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #7-8</ref>\n\nDevil Dinosaur and Moon Girl\'s next opponent came in the form of Kid Kree - a misunderstood Kree boy who had failed to enter the academy twice, who sought to capture an Inhuman to impress his father and make a name for himself on Earth as [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] had - who disguised himself as a new student, Marvin Ellis, in Lunella\'s class. Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur fought Kid Kree several times,<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #9; #11-12</ref> once being separated by [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]], who recognized their fight as the childish squabble it was, but still entrusted Moon Girl with a device to contact her if things ever got out of hand.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #10</ref>\n\nLunella is then approached by Hulk, who gives her the Banner B.O.X. (Brain Omnicompetence Examiner), and is surprised when she solves it in mere seconds, proving that Lunella is the smartest person on Earth. After consulting experts, Moon Girl, Hulk and Devil Dinosaur encounter [[Mole Man]], who was attacking the city with a group of monsters. The next day, at her lab, Lunella ends up having a vision of herself in the future, where she is approached by Earth\'s smartest heroes. After school, she is approached by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who takes her for a walk when Hulk appears. When the two start fighting, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur manage to contain them while protecting the civilians, until both of them are left unconscious. Meanwhile, [[Doctor Doom]] is surprised to discover that Moon Girl is considered the smartest person on Earth and vows to prove himself superior.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #13-14</ref> During science class, Lunella is attacked by robot drones until she is saved by [[Riri Williams]]. They follow the drones to a nearby alley, where Moon Girl encounters Doctor Doom. After Doom escapes, Moon Girl and Ironheart go to Moon Girl\'s secret lab, where they discover that the energy signatures of the drones are mystic in origin. While tracing Doom\'s location, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur arrive at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum (Marvel Comics)|Sanctum Sanctorum]] and are found by [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #15</ref> Waking up from a dream, Lunella is reunited with Devil, who was shrunk down by Strange. While walking back home, Moon Girl and two of her classmates are attacked by Doctor Doom and his Doombots. Moon Girl uses an enlargement potion on herself to help Doctor Strange fight Doom and his robots. A few nights later, while installing an energy sensing probe, Moon Girl is found by five members of the [[X-Men]].<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #16</ref> Arriving at an abandoned mall, Moon Girl reengineers a Cerebro helmet with the Omni-Wave Projector to locate Doom, only for her and the X-Men to travel back to the 1980s. Once there, Doctor Doom arrives with an army of Doombots. The X-Men and Devil fight the Doombots until Moon Girl takes off the helmet, sending them back to the present, where they discover that Doom is actually a Doombot. Lunella takes the Doombot to her lab to analyze it.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #17</ref> Lunella later makes a major discovery about her Inhuman power: it only activates during a full moon. She then encounters an army of Doombots, along with Thing, Hulk, Ms. Marvel, Ironheart, Doctor Strange, Kid Kree and the Killer Folk, who went to her aid after being recruited by Lunella.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #18</ref>\n\nLunella then receives a call for help from an alien girl named Illa and, after building a spaceship, goes to space with Devil and crash land on a moon. While exploring, Lunella discovers that Illa is the moon.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #19</ref> She soon realizes that Illa is lonely and wants company and does not understand Lunella at all. After a brief fight between Devil and some giant bugs, Lunella leaves, despite Illa\'s objections. In the process, she is sent to a parallel universe where she meets another version of herself and Devil Dinosaur. Meanwhile, the Doombot head creates robotic versions of Lunella to avoid suspicions of her absence.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #20</ref> After fighting their counterparts, Devil Girl and Moon Dinosaur, Lunella and Devil get back on their spacecraft and return to Illa who tells them that they\'ll never leave her. Back home, the Doombot head begins to have problems with one of Lunella robots. Moon Girl and Devil manage to find [[Ego the Living Planet]] and reunite him with Illa, while the Doombot discovers that the Lunella robot is acting independently.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #21-22</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the Doombot head has created multiple Moon Girl replacement robots who to his surprise are acting like real little girls.{{issue|date=October 2017}} He tells them that they will be obsolete when the real Lunella returns.{{issue|date=October 2017}} While up in space Lunella has united Ego and Illa as a family.{{issue|date=October 2017}} On the way to Earth she uses the Omniwave projector to tearfully return Devil Dinosaur to Moon Boy in the Savage Land where she thinks he belongs and then returns to New York where she tosses it away in the trash.{{issue|date=October 2017}}\n\nAdmitting she was wrong Moon Girl brought him back as she, Ben Grim, and Johnny Storm reformed the Fantastic Four and even gave Devil his own uniform.<ref>\'\'Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur\'\' #29</ref> Afterwards while Wilson Fisks\'s daughter Princess is enrolled in her school Moon Girl decides to turn Devil into a human boy and enroll him in her class to tone down his destructive accidents.

After a brief fight, the team is captured until they break out when Daisy uses her powers to destroy the Helicarrier they were in. While trying to break Devil out of his cage, Moon Girl meets Leer, the Inhuman Karnak mentioned, who knocks her unconscious when the Helicarrier crash lands. Fortunately, Moon Girl and Devil have switched brains just in time, enabling Moon Girl to lead the Warriors to an Inhuman prison camp. There, the Warriors plan a jailbreak with the imprisoned Inhumans when the Underground resistance arrives to help them.

Devil is depicted as having the power of speech and states: "Moon-Boy hated me. Moon-Boy had to die. Moon-Boy tasted bad and gave me considerable rectal distress".<ref>\'\'Nextwave\'\' #12 (March 2007)</ref> Devil\'s uncharacteristic behavior in the \'\'Nextwave\'\' series and also the fact that Moon-Boy, who is said to be dead but shows up later on friendly terms with a non-speaking Devil Dinosaur in \'\'Heroes for Hire\'\', has given rise to speculation about whether the \'\'Nextwave\'\' stories should be seen as occurring in the main Marvel continuity or not.<ref>In a 2005 interview, writer [[Warren Ellis]] commenting on his Nextwave stories stated: "I think it has to be a self contained universe. It takes from Marvel history, but I wouldn\'t necessarily want to drag mainstream Marvel into it for fear of what I would do to it". [Jennifer M. Contino (2005-12-08). "Ellis Talks Nextwave & Ultimate Extinction", http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004516 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013060643/http://comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic%3Bf%3D36%3Bt%3D004516 |date=2007-10-13}}] In 2006, Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]] stated that "for the time being" Nextwave is set in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity [Wade Gum (2006-07-01). "Heros Con: Joe Quesada Panel", {{cite web|url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm |title=Wizard Entertainment |access-date=2007-07-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711133600/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/000765389.cfm |archive-date=2007-07-11}}] In contradiction to these earlier statements, recent Marvel publications such as \'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\'\' and \'\'Civil War: Battle Damage Report\'\' (February 2007) seem to portray Nextwave\'s activities as occurring in the mainstream Marvel continuity. Nextwave\'s entry in \'\'Civil War: Battle Damage Report\'\' states: "Recent intelligence suggests some or all Nextwave members unknowingly had their memories and/or personalities altered by their new employers (H.A.T.E.)". The Nextwave entry in \'\'Civil War: Battle Damage Report\'\' may be evidence of an editorial decision to include the Nextwave team in the main Marvel continuity in a way that provides a plot device to explain away inconsistencies caused by the previous editorial position that \'\'Nextwave\'\' was set in an alternate universe.</ref> A more recent Marvel publication, the \'\'Marvel Pets Handbook\'\', states that the Devil Dinosaur in Nextwave was a clone.<ref>\'\'Marvel Pets Handbook\'\' #1 (June 2009)</ref>\n\n===What If?===\nIn Marvel\'s \'\'What If?\'\' series, the alternative reality of Earth-34882 is presented in which Devil is part of a team of super animals assembled by Howard the Duck.<ref>\'\'What If?\'\' #34 (August 1982)</ref>\n\n===Planet Hulk===\nDuring the \'\'[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\'\' storyline, an unidentified Red Hulk is the Baron of the [[Battleworld]] domain of Greenland under the name \'\'\'Red King\'\'\'. A variation of [[Captain America]] called the Captain and his Devil Dinosaur were sent into Greenland by [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor Doom]] and [[Doctor Strange|Sheriff Strange]] in order to kill Red King when it turned out that he has the Captain\'s [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] whom the Captain has been looking for.<ref>\'\'Planet Hulk\'\' #1</ref>\n\nAfter the Captain and his Devil Dinosaur made their way to the Mud Kingdom where the Red King resided, both of them raided the Red King\'s palace. When the Captain demanded that he release Bucky, the Red King revealed that God Emperor Doom lied to him and that he already sent his head to God Emperor Doom a month ago. While grabbing the cybernetic arm of Bucky, the Red King stated that Bucky wasn\'t his prisoner but his trophy.<ref>\'\'Planet Hulk\'\' #4</ref>\n\nWhen the Red King offered the Captain to join his army into attacking God Emperor Doom, the Captain declined, where he managed to fight and kill the Red King. Upon the Captain killing his counterpart that was a Hulk called Doc Green, the Captain threw the Red King\'s head in front of the Tribal Hulks causing them to stop fighting Devil Dinosaur.<ref>\'\'Planet Hulk\'\' #5</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Devil Dinosaur appears in \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\' episode "The Devil Dinosaur You Say!", voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} He joins forces with a time-displaced [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to save [[Moon-Boy]]\'s tribe from the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>\'\'Super Hero Squad\'\', Season 2, Episode 18 (October 2011) https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1847442/</ref>\n* Devil Dinosaur appears in \'\'[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]\'\', with vocal effects provided by [[Steve Blum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/hulk-and-the-agents-of-smash-cort-lane-paul-dini-marvel-interview/ |title=\'Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.\' Interview |access-date=2013-09-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827064704/http://comicsalliance.com/hulk-and-the-agents-of-smash-cort-lane-paul-dini-marvel-interview/ |archive-date=2013-08-27}}</ref> In the episode "Savage Land", the agents of S.M.A.S.H. visit the [[Savage Land|titular region]], but are attacked by Devil Dinosaur while he is under [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]]\'s control. After being freed, Devil Dinosaur joins the agents of S.M.A.S.H. in foiling Sauron\'s plans, befriends [[Rick Jones (character)|A-Bomb]], and becomes the group\'s "pet". In the episodes "Homecoming" and "Spidey, I Blew Up the Dinosaur", Devil Dinosaur gets locked in the agents of S.M.A.S.H.\'s weapons vault, which gets taken by the [[Leader (character)|Leader]], who feeds the Tyrannosaur a gamma bomb that enlarges and sends him on a rampage throughout New York City before the agents of S.M.A.S.H. and [[Spider-Man]] save him. In the episode "Days of Future Smash, Part 1: The Dino Era", a time-traveling [[Hulk]] encounters a younger version of Devil Dinosaur, who joins the former in his mission to undo the Leader\'s damage to the timeline before the Hulk takes the young Tyrannosaur to the Savage Land to preserve his existence. In the series finale, "Planet Monster" Pt. 2, Devil Dinosaur helps the agents of S.M.A.S.H. and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], among other heroes, combat the [[Supreme Intelligence]]\'s forces.\n** An intelligent, alternate timeline version of Devil Dinosaur called \'\'\'El Diablo\'\'\' also appears in "Days of Future Smash, Part 1: The Dino Era", after the Leader creates an alternate timeline where the Earth is ruled by dinosaurs and King Sauron, the latter of whom El Diablo opposes. With help from Spider-Man\'s counterpart, Spider-Raptor, and the agents of S.M.A.S.H., El Diablo is able to overthrow Sauron, befriending Moon Boy in the process.\n** A [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampiric]] alternate timeline version of Devil Dinosaur appears in "Days of Future Smash, Part 5: The Tomorrow Smashers". Using a time belt, the Leader summons it, among other paradoxical creatures from the alternate timelines he created, to help him fight the agents of S.M.A.S.H.
