The character was later killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] in \'\'[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]\'\' #319 (July 1986).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nCommander Kraken was a self-styled modern-day pirate who fought [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. Namor used the [[Kraken (character)|Kraken]], a gigantic octopus, to defeat his foe.<ref>\'\'Sub-Mariner\'\' #27 (July 1970)</ref> After a run-in with [[Tigra|The Cat]],<ref>\'\'The Cat\'\' #3 April 1973</ref> he later reappears with a heavily modified look, undergoing plastic surgery and acquiring a rocket-powered peg leg and an electrified sword.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #93-94 (Dec. 1976-Jan. 1977)</ref>\n\nIn issue #121 of \'\'[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]\'\' (which takes place after the character\'s appearance in \'\'The Cat\'\' and before his revamped look and appearance in \'\'Iron Man\'\'), it is revealed that Commander Kraken is the head of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]\'s naval division.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/28559/|title = GCD :: Issue :: Daredevil #121 &#91;Regular Edition&#93;}}</ref> But this is the only time the character is ever mentioned as being associated with that terrorist group. In 2009, Marvel would create a new character simply called [[Kraken (character)|Kraken]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/566410/|title = GCD :: Issue :: Secret Warriors #2}}</ref> that would be an integral part of Hydra\'s operations.\n\nLater, Commander Kraken was invited to a meeting organized by [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)|Gary Gilbert]], who wanted to discuss counter-measures against the threat by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]] at the "Bar With No Name". Kraken attended and was shot dead along with all the other criminals present by the Scourge himself, who had infiltrated the meeting as the bartender.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = |issue = #319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nCommander Kraken is among the dead characters seen in [[Erebus]] when [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] travels to the Underworld. Here, he had reverted to his original look from his first appearance. He was later seen as a member of [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]\'s jury (alongside [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Armless Tiger Man]], Artume, [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], [[Iron Monger]], [[Jack O\'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O\'Lantern]], Kyknos, Nessus, [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Scourge of the Underworld]], and [[Veranke]]) at [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]]\' trial.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hercules\'\' #129</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:commkraken.jpg|thumb|150px|The revamped Commander Kraken battles Iron Man. From issue #93 of \'\'The Invincible Iron Man\'\'.]]\n\nCommander Kraken had a hook on his left hand that was capable of emitting an electrical shock, this was later replaced with a functional bionic hand. His left leg was also bionic, and allowed him to fly. His electro-sword was capable of firing electricity and could reflect force and energy attacks.\n\nCommander Kraken originally used huge squid-shaped submarines he called "Squid Ships" for his piratical conquests. When he revamped his look in 1976, his vehicle of choice was a [[Brigantine]] called "The Albatross". This old style pirate ship could transform into a sleek golden high powered submarine.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Commander_Kraken_%28Earth-616%29 Commander Kraken] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/commander-kraken/4005-14450/ Commander Kraken] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Namor}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1970]]\n[[Category:Fictional amputees]]\n[[Category:Fictional pirates]]\n[[Category:Fictional swordfighters in comics]]\n[[Category:Hydra (comics) agents]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics male supervillains]]'}]}}}}
