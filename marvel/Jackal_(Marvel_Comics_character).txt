The original and best known incarnation \'\'\'Miles Warren\'\'\' was originally introduced in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #31 (December 1965) as a [[professor]] at the fictional Empire State University. Later storylines established him as also being a scientist researching genetics and biochemistry, and revealed an unhealthy romantic obsession he had for [[Gwen Stacy]]. Warren was driven mad with grief and jealousy so he created his Jackal alter-ego to seek revenge on Spider-Man, whom he blamed for Gwen\'s [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|tragic death]]. To this end, he trained himself in [[martial arts]], and created a green suit and gauntlets with claw-like razors. Although the Jackal initially didn\'t possess any [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], he later gained enhanced strength, speed and agility by mixing his genes with those of a [[jackal]].  \n\nThe Jackal was introduced in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #129 (February 1974), but his human identity was not revealed until \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #148 (September 1975). Originally one of Spider-Man\'s less popular rogues, the character rose to prominence after being one of the first in the [[Marvel Universe]] to master [[cloning]] technology, and creating various clones of Spider-Man, like [[Ben Reilly]] and [[Kaine Parker]], as well as of other characters, including himself. His experiments went on to play a major role in several popular Spider-Man storylines, such as the "[[Clone Saga]]" (1994-1996), "[[Spider-Island]]" (2011), and "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" (2016-2017). \n\nIn 2014, \'\'[[IGN]]\'\' ranked the Jackal as Spider-Man\'s 17th greatest enemy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|website=IGN|date=16 April 2014}}</ref> The character has been featured in several media adaptations of Spider-Man, including animated series and video games. \n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character first appears in [[The Amazing Spider-Man 129|\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #129]] (February 1974), and was created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Ross Andru]].<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 72|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Writer Gerry Conway and artist Ross Andru introduced two major new characters to Spider-Man\'s world and the Marvel Universe in this self-contained issue.

Prior to his Jackal reintroduction, his appearances were essentially limited to the occasional cameo in which he acts as simple background to Spider-Man\'s civilian life as a college student.\n\nWhen named at all in these early appearances, he is called only "Professor Warren". A "Mister Warren" had previously appeared in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #8 (January 1964) but he is a high school science teacher rather than a college professor, and is physically very distinct from Miles Warren. Despite this, Conway has said it was always his interpretation that "Mister Warren", "Professor Warren", and Professor Miles Warren/Jackal were the same character.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= #44| page= 12|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nThe character was featured in the controversial 1990s "[[Clone Saga]]" [[story arc]], the 2011 storyline "[[Spider-Island]]", and the 2016-2017 storyline "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]".\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Miles Warren===\n\'\'\'Miles Warren\'\'\' was a [[professor]] of [[biology]] at Empire State University,<ref name="mnyc">{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 30–33 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> where he would meet [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Gwen Stacy]].<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #31.

After Gwen is [[The Night Gwen Stacy Died|murdered]] by the Green Goblin, Warren swears vengeance on Spider-Man, since it was reported that it was Spider-Man who killed Gwen.<ref name="ASM149">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #149.

Miles is also the brother of science teacher [[Raymond Warren (comics)|Raymond Warren]] of Midtown High School.<ref>\'\'Untold Tales of Spider-Man\'\' #25 (July 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Early career====\nMiles is an assistant of the [[High Evolutionary]] at Wundagore Mountain after earning his Ph.D in biochemistry. Warren assists the High Evolutionary in experiments that involve turning animals into humans and vice versa. There is conflict between Warren and the High Evolutionary because Warren succeeds in creating "New Men" who looked practically human, whereas the High Evolutionary is not able to. Eventually, Warren evolves a jackal that exhibits a [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Jekyll and Hyde personality]]. When the test subject escapes, the High Evolutionary banishes Warren from Wundagore. Warren continues his research and eventually settles down with a woman named Monica who bears him two children who are all killed in what was originally believed to be a car crash; however, it is later revealed to be an assault by his highly evolved Man-Jackal envious of his creator.<ref>\'\'Scarlet Spider Unlimited\'\' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====The Jackal\'s origin====\nThe day after Gwen\'s death, Warren\'s lab assistant Anthony Serba reveals he successfully cloned a frog using their research technology. Warren gives Serba tissue samples of Gwen and Peter, telling Serba it\'s of rat cells. Sometime later, Serba confronts Warren, stating that the clones are human and must be destroyed immediately. Panicking, Warren attempts to cover Serba\'s mouth to shut up, accidentally suffocating Serba. Unable to accept responsibility for his actions, Warren develops a second personality to carry the weight of his misdeeds dubbed "The Jackal". He further develops his alter ego by fashioning a green suit and gauntlets with sharp, claw-like razors on each finger, and by training himself athletically.<ref name="ASM149"/> During this time, he also continues to experiment with cloning humans. [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] is the first successful clone of Peter despite suffering from a slow cloning degeneration and having regenerative abilities to elude death several times.<ref name="S-I Deadly">\'\'Spider-Island: Deadly Foes\'\'. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Jackal\'s hatred for Spider-Man manifests in his belief that Spider-Man is solely responsible for allowing Gwen, whom he loved, to die at the Goblin\'s hands. He harasses Spider-Man numerous times, setting Spider-Man up against other adversaries. Warren allies himself with the [[Punisher]] against Spider-Man.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal next attempts to incite a gang war between [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Doctor Octopus]].<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #130.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Sometime after, he learns Spider-Man\'s identity.\n\nOut of his numerous attempts to create clones of Peter, only one is a perfect copy of the original. He also creates two clones of himself, one a direct copy and the other a modified clone harboring the [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] virus. The Jackal helps the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Anton Miguel Rodriguez|Tarantula]] (Anton Miguel Rodriguez) escape prison, and the two become partners.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #147. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Jackal captures Spider-Man, but promptly lets go after proving that Spider-Man is no match for the Jackal in a fair fight. He then lures his nemesis to [[Shea Stadium]] and manipulates into battling his perfect clone of Peter by binding \'\'[[Daily Bugle]]\'\' reporter [[Ned Leeds]] to a bomb that only the original Spider-Man can disarm. But when a clone of Gwen tears off the Jackal\'s mask and confronts him on his crimes, Warren finally accepts responsibility for his actions. He attempts to correct his wrongdoings by freeing Leeds, only to be caught in the bomb\'s explosion.<ref name="ASM149"/>\n\n====Clone Saga====\n[[File:Jackal (Miles Warren - circa 1994).jpg|thumb|upright|The Jackal as he appeared throughout the "[[Clone Saga]]". Interior art of \'\'Spider-Man: The Jackal Files\'\' #1 (August 1994). Art by Dan Lawlis.]]\nDuring the "[[Clone Saga]]", it was much later revealed that the clone of Peter had survived the explosion and gone into hiding under the alias of [[Ben Reilly]], and the Jackal who died at Shea Stadium was later revealed to be a clone. Nearly five years later, another clone of Jackal would marry the original clone of Gwen and the two would live under the assumed names Warren Miles and Gwen Miles.<ref name="Web of Spider-Man #125">\'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #125. Marvel Comics.</ref> This clone of Warren eventually died of the clone degeneration that afflicted most of the Jackal\'s clones.

Marvel Comics.</ref> his physical abilities had previously been the result of training rather than any superhuman powers.\n\nWhen Reilly returns years later to [[New York City]] as the Scarlet Spider and allied with Spider-Man, the Jackal also returned to unleash his clone army<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #399 (March 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> and convinced both Parker and Reilly that the latter was the original Spider-Man, and the former was the clone. The Jackal created a number of clones of Peter who came into conflict with Spider-Man, the Scarlet Spider,<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #149. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Kaine.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man\'\' #60. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ultimately, the Jackal, in the process of attempting to kill and replace millions of people with clones that he could control, was killed falling off a tall building while trying to save the clone of Gwen.<ref>\'\'Maximum Clonage Omega\'\' (July 1995). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIt was ultimately revealed that the Jackal and this storyline\'s other major players had unknowingly been duped by [[Norman Osborn]]. The Jackal and various others (including Kaine) had been tricked into thinking that Reilly was the original and that Peter was the clone. All of the Jackal\'s machinations were influenced by his incorrect assertion that he knew who the real Peter was.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man: The Osborn Journals\'\'. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Spider-Island====\nThe Jackal later returned in the "[[Spider-Island]]" storyline, being further genetically altered to the point where he frequently displayed animalistic tendencies. His body is always cold, requiring him to wear a thick fur coat even in the hottest weather. He\'s now a crime lord calling himself "\'\'\'The Professor\'\'\'", and allied himself with Hammerhead but the two eventually went to jail.<ref name="Daredevil Vs.

Before this seemingly perfect copy of Gwen died at Abby-L\'s hands, it was revealed the copy actually had some degeneration on her hand, suggesting not being perfect after all. Abby-L was also infected with the Carrion virus and had Carrion\'s same abilities. Abby-L was manipulated into killing the other clone of Gwen who was living in London under the alias of Joyce Delaney, and coming into conflict with the Jackal and Kaine.<ref name="S-I Deadly"/> With his own ulterior motives, the Jackal manipulated various gang leaders into adorning duplicate costumes of Spider-Man to cause chaos in New York City.<ref name="ASM667">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #667</ref> He experimented on the Spider King\'s [[Captain America|host form]] to spread of New York City\'s infestation on a global scale.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #670">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #670.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIt\'s later revealed that the Jackal has been monitoring Peter\'s accidental creation of [[Alpha (Marvel Comics)|Alpha]], and has set his sights on Spider-Man\'s new protégé.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #692-693">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #692-693.

But his plans fail as the Alpha energy cannot be cloned, resulting in a collection of powerless, near-mindless copies of Alpha, all of which are destroyed when the enraged Alpha breaks free. It was revealed that the two versions of Jackal that Spider-Man and Alpha fought were also clones.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #692. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Superior Spider-Man era====\nWhen Otto Octavius\'s mind possessed Spider-Man\'s body, the [[X-Men]] battles a 30&nbsp;ft. human-spider hybrid attacking New York which turns out to be a human created by the Jackal using [[Mister Sinister]]\'s works.<ref name="Avenging Spider-Man #16">\'\'Avenging Spider-Man\'\' #16.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy====\nBen\'s dissolved remains were collected by the Jackal and was resurrected thanks to a new cloning process. However, the Jackal found problems with the cellular degradation. He had Ben killed 26 more times, all of which had Ben\'s life (and most of Peter\'s) flash before his eyes. The ordeal of repeated death caused Ben to become mentally unbalanced and morally ambiguous, due to the trauma and very soul being damaged from being removed and replaced over and over.<ref>\'\'Ben Reily: Scarlet Spider\'\' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Ben eventually breaks free and knocks out the Jackal. After improving Warren\'s formula, Ben makes clones of Miles and persuades the Jackal that \'\'he\'\' is a clone, thereby making it nearly impossible to tell who is the real one. Now free with a number of clone of Miles as servants, Ben acts as the new Jackal during the "[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]" storyline and is determined to repay the people who have heavily influenced Ben\'s and Peter\'s lives with the Jackal\'s technology to make sure that no one has to suffer again and that those who have can become whole, and even does this by establishing New U Technologies.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #22">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 4 #22.

The so-called clone that does not melt realizes that he \'\'is\'\' the true Warren and vows to have revenge on Ben as the true Jackal. Ben returns to a safe-house and finds Miles in his Jackal outfit waiting in the living room. The Jackal proceeds to burn Ben\'s safe-house down and engages in one final battle. Ben defeats the Jackal and leaves him in the burning house to die.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 4 #24. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Jackal however, survived the fire and targeted the neural net that was built by Dr. Yesenia Rosario when the woman was doing a presentation of it at Empire State University. The Jackal was defeated by Spider-Man and [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]] as Dr. Rosario destroys her own invention by setting it to self-destruct.<ref>\'\'Marvel Team Up\'\' vol. 4 #1.

The Jackal later spliced his genes with the genetics of a jackal, having the strength, speed and agility amplified to superhuman levels. Having an in-depth knowledge of Peter Parker resulted by cloning him repeatedly, the Jackal is unaffected by the [[Spider-Man: One More Day|worldwide mind purging]] of Spider-Man\'s identity.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #545. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Copies of Jackal==\nPrior to the death of the Warren clone at Shea Stadium,<ref name="ASM149"/> he had created a clone of himself. The clone remained in stasis within a cloning casket that malfunctioned and super-aged the clone beyond death. Eventually, it emerged and became known as Carrion that wielded power and had no conscience for its actions. He was the first carrier of the Carrion virus, which Warren designed to destroy humanity. Carrion contained all Warren\'s memories which contained within his RNA, that included his hatred and knowledge of Spider-Man\'s secret identity. Carrion wielded the power to create a Red Dust that would spread as pestilence as well as his touch that would incapacitate or even cause organic matter to degenerate to the point of disintegration.<ref>\'\'Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #28.
