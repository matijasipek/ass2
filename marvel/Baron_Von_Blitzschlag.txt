He\'s someone who had off panel run-ins with [1940s era] guys like the [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]], and [[Thin Man (comics)|Thin Man]]. But no one really remembers him. The way he works in this book is that he\'s one of the guys in [[Hank Pym]]\'s lab in [[Avengers: The Initiative|the Initiative]]. You read stuff like \'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\' and you see that they\'re making heroes like [[The Order (comics)#The initiative|the new Champions]]. And that\'s one of the places he comes in. The Baron is a [[Nazi]] [[geneticist]] who is helping out the Initiative in the same way [[Wernher von Braun]] was helping out the [[NASA]] space program. As much as we hate the Nazis and they were awful human beings, we used guys who worked on the [[V-2]] rockets to help us put men on the moon and the Russians were using them too. There\'s something like that going on in the Initiative but I can\'t say any more about it.}}\n\nOriginally, Blitzschlag\'s role was going to be filled by the pre-existing character [[Arnim Zola]]. This plan was changed due to [[Ed Brubaker]]\'s plans for Zola in \'\'[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]\'\', and Blitzschlag was created to fill the villain\'s role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=138571 |title=CHRISTOS GAGE JOINS DAN SLOTT ON THE INITIATIVE |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2008-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206164559/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=138571 |archivedate=2009-02-06 }}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDuring [[World War II]], Baron Werner Von Blitzschlag was a Nazi supervillain who fought an assortment of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] superheroes.<ref name=ati15>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #15</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion to [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Baron Von Blitzschlag is recruited into [[Avengers: The Initiative|The Initiative]] and works at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], seemingly taking the position as the head of scientific research.

After discovering MVP\'s naturally formed peak human abilities, he argues with [[Hank Pym]] over whether exploiting MVP\'s genetic material in order to create more [[superheroes]] is [[medical ethics|ethical]]. \n\nWhen the  Vulturions (criminals using the flying technology created by the original [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]) stole a briefcase containing classified research on [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] from Von Blitzschlag, he attempted to stop them, and displayed a power to generate electricity.<ref>\'\'Avengers: Initiative\'\' #7</ref>\n\nVon Blitzschlag creates several clones of MVP, three of which become the [[Scarlet Spiders]].<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative Annual\'\' #1</ref> Blitzschlag becomes emotionally attached to his three \'sons\'<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #10</ref> and shows distress when two of them are killed in combat<ref name=ati22>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #22</ref> and the third one rejects him.<ref name=ati22 /><ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #23</ref>\n\nWhen a new clone of MVP named KIA interfaces with [[Armory (comics)|Armory]]\'s Tactigon weapon, he remembers the death of the original like it was his own.

Cloud 9 then gets Komodo to listen to Hardball explain his actions by mentioning how Hardball aided the Shadow Initiative.
