Seeking to return to a more impressive size, he has his agents arrange the abduction of [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]]. After his scientists study Banner\'s physiology and learn what allows him to transform into the Hulk, Annihilus is mutated into a gigantic, more monstrous form.<ref>\'\'Thanos vs. Hulk\'\' #1-4.

It allows him to manipulate cosmic energy in order to control the molecular structure of matter. The rod is capable of projecting vast amounts of destructive energy and concussive force. Continuous exposure to the cosmic energies of the rod has also retarded the aging process of its wielder, making Annihilus virtually immortal.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWith the battle between Legion and a team of X-Men sent back in time to stop him seen worldwide on television, mutants were revealed for the first time a full decade before they were seen in the normal Marvel Universe. Apocalypse made the decision to move up his quest for the creation of a world in his image: a world where mutants ruled and Survival of the Fittest was the only law.<ref>\'\' X-Men: Alpha\'\' one-shot. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn this harsh world, the X-Man known as [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] would travel to the Negative Zone where she met Ahmyor, a freedom fighter native to the Negative Zone who joined the rebellion against their malicious leader, Blastaar. The two would exchange fists rather than greetings at first, though the battle would end in a stalemate. Once Ahmyor realized she meant him no harm, the two called a truce and he began to explain to her his situation. The people wanted to restore control to their previous ruler, Annihilus, who was also malevolent, but the lesser of two evils in this case. For some time, Ahmyor had been haunted by visions of their tortured leader Annihilus who had been made undone in his quest for order through domination. He could feel his gnawing need for power, the endless struggle that drove him to madness, but blue-clad interlopers called the Fantastic Four would inevitably see to his end.<ref>\'\'Blink\'\' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDespite not having any memories of herself, the girl found the spirit of rebellion to be a familiar one and joined his cause. Over the course of a week, Ahmyor would fall in love with this angel. She made him extremely happy as both a warrior and as a man and helped restore his soul. Eventually, the couple was captured and taken to Blastaar who revealed that Ahmyor was actually Annihilus. Blink felt betrayed as she believed she had done the honorable thing by aiding in a rebellion, but it appeared that she was only helping a dictator reclaim his empire. Ahmyor explained that he was amnesiac just like Blink was and had no recollection of his former life. When he was removed from power, he regressed to an earlier, humanoid stage in his being. However, his knowledge of the truth caused him to begin reverting into his insectoid form.<ref>\'\'Blink\'\' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBlastaar had previously acquired the Annihilation Cannon, a deadly invention made by Annihilus that could not be fired without the Cosmic Control Rod joined to the form of its creator. With Ahmyor/Annihilus now in his clutches, Blastaar finally had the key to active this ultimate weapon and he planned on using it to destroy Earth. Suddenly, Blink with a renewed dedication to her beloved and found him bound to the Annihilation Cannon. She moved quickly to free him, but discovered that the device had been altered so that it would explode if Annihilus was removed from it. Ahmyor\'s transformation into Annihilus was nearly complete and he urged her to leave him and the Negative Zone as he was no longer the man she loved. With tears in her eyes, Blink teleported Ahmyor away, sent the Annihilation Cannon to Blastaar\'s position, and teleported herself back home where the X-Men had been frantically searching for her. Subsequently, Annihilus was once again himself. An image fluttered across his mind\'s eye, causing him to pause, and giving him a moment\'s worth of peace. It was an image of the only being ever to reach him, the only one he ever loved. However, it faded just as quickly as it had come and was replaced with rage that burned in his heart as thoughts of revenge boiled within him.<ref>\'\'Blink\'\' #4.

He is confronted and defeated by the Fantastic Four.<ref>\'\'Marvel Mangaverse\'\' vol. 2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] encountered an Annihilus-like creature in their first foray into the [[Negative Zone#Ultimate Marvel (The N-Zone)|N-Zone]]. Translating machines implanted in the Four\'s space suits dubbed the creature \'\'\'Nihil\'\'\', though Nihil himself stated this is a [[caste]] title and not his proper name. Nihil ruled over a space station composed of the fused remains of several alien space ships. It orbited near a dying red dwarf star for warmth because the whole N-Zone is experiencing [[Heat death of the universe|entropic decay]].<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four\'\' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLike Annihilus, Nihil and his caste are from a species that can live over a million years. Not wanting to die before he is supposed to naturally, when Nihil learned that the UFF were from a different, younger universe he engineered a plan to escape and kill them. [[Human Torch#Ultimate Marvel|Johnny Storm]], who for the entire trip had been experiencing discomfort, fell ill and was rushed by [[Invisible Woman#Ultimate Marvel|Sue]] back to their ship. [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]] and [[Thing (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Ben Grimm]] went along with her but once they returned to tell Nihil of their situation Nihil revealed his intention to steal their ship, named by Johnny as the \'\'Awesome\'\', and go to Earth. He exploded his translation devices, thereby rupturing Reed and Ben\'s space suits and exposing them to the N-Zone\'s highly acidic atmosphere. Nihil then sent his previously unseen soldiers to kill them but Reed sealed his damaged suit by covering his shattered face mask with his hand, and Ben discovered his lungs filter out poisons, enabling him to battle Nihil.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four\'\' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the ensuing fight, Ben ripped Nihil\'s right wing off, most of Nihil\'s soldiers were beaten by the enslaved alien refugees living on the space station, and Ben and Reed escaped to the \'\'Awesome\'\'. Nihil then launched a [[bioship]] after the UFF when they were racing back to Earth. Nihil\'s flagship managed to make it through but both ships crashed on to the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Another battle started between Nihil and the Fantastic Four. During it, Johnny Storm emerged from the \'\'Awesome\'\', discovering that he would periodically enter hibernation and shed his dead skin cells so that his powers would regenerate, and then entered the fight. At the climax of the battle, Nihil pinned Reed to the ground and opened his jaws to consume him, but Reed, stating that he was better than Nihil because he could adapt and Nihil just wanted to rule, stretched and jammed a plasma emitting weapon into Nihil\'s mouth. Nihil tried to pry the rod out by the trigger and his head was subsequently blown up. Nihil is at this time presumed dead and his body is most likely in government possession. Many of Nihil\'s soldiers survived and they were presumably captured if not killed. The lasting effect of this battle is that the Fantastic Four\'s secrecy was blown and the team had to be given a formal introduction to the world.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four\'\' #18.
